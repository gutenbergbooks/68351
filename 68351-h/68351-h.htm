<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> should</span> like some time to tell how
Tetherby came to his end; he, too, was a
victim of materialism, as his father had been
before him; but when he died, he left this
story, addressed among his papers to me;
and I am sure he meant that all the world
(or such part of it as cares to think) should
know it. He had told it, or partly told it, to
us before; in fragments, in suggestions, in
those midnight talks that earnest young men
still have in college, or had, in 1870.</p>

<p>Tetherby came from that strange, cold,
Maine coast, washed in its fjords and
beaches by a clear, cold sea, which brings it
fogs of winter but never haze of summer;
where men eat little, think much, drink only
water, and yet live intense lives; where the
village people, in their long winters away
from the world, in an age of revivals had
their waves of atheism, and would transform,
in those days, their pine meeting-houses into
Shakspere clubs, and logically make a cult of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>infidelity; now, with railways, I suppose all
that has ceased; they read Shakspere as
little as the scriptures, and the Sunday newspaper
replaces both. Such a story&mdash;such an
imagination&mdash;as Tetherby’s, could not happen
now&mdash;perhaps. But they take life earnestly
in that remote, ardent province; they think
coldly; and, when you least expect it, there
comes in their lives, so hard and sharp and
practical, a burst of passion.</p>

<p>He came to Newbridge to study law, and
soon developed a strange faculty for debate.
The first peculiarity was his name&mdash;which
first appeared and was always spelled, C. S.
J. J. Tetherby in the catalogue, despite the
practice, which was to spell one’s name in
full. Of course, speculation was rife as to the
meaning of this portentous array of initials;
and soon, after his way of talk was known,
arose a popular belief that they stood for
nothing less than Charles Stuart Jean Jacques.
Nothing less would justify the intense leaning
of his mind, radical as it was, for all that
was mystical, ideal, old. But afterwards we
learned that he had been so named by his
curious father, Colonel Sir John Jones, after
a supposed loyalist ancestor, who had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>flourished in the time of the Revolution, and
had gone to Maine to get away from it;
Tetherby’s father being evidently under the
impression that the two titles formed a component
part of the ancestor’s identity.</p>

<p>Rousseau Tetherby, as he continued to be
called, was a tall, thin, broad-shouldered fellow,
of great muscular strength and yet with
feeble health, given to hallucinations and
morbid imaginations which he would recount
to you in that deep monotone of twang that
seemed only fit to sell a horse in. The boys
made fun of Tetherby; he bore it with a
splendid smile and a twinkle in his ice-blue
eye, until one day it went too far, and then he
tackled the last offender and chucked him off
the boat-house float into the river. He would
have rowed upon the university crew, but that
his digestion gave out; strong as he was in
mind and body, nothing, that went for the nutrition
and fostering of life, was well with him.
Such men as he are repellent to the sane,
and are willed by the world to die alone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some one on that night, I remember, had
said something derogatory about Goethe’s
theory of colors. A dry subject, an abstruse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>subject, a useless subject&mdash;as one might
think&mdash;but it roused Tetherby to sudden
fury. He made a vehement defence of the
great poet-philosopher against the dry, barren
mathematics of the Newtonian science.</p>

<p>“Do you cipherers think all that is reducible
to numbers? to so many beats per
second, like your own dry hearts? Sound
may be nothing but a quicker rattle&mdash;is it
but a rattle, the music in your souls? If
light is but the impact of more rapid molecules,
does MAN bring nothing else, when he
worships the glory of the dawn? You say,
tones are a few thousand beats per second,
and colors a few billion beats per second&mdash;what
becomes of all the numbers left between?
If colored lights count all these
billions, up from red to violet, and white
light is the sum of all the colors, what can
be its number but infinity? But is a white
light GOD? Or would you cipherers make
of God a cipher? Smoke looks yellow against
the sky, and blue against the forest&mdash;but how
can its <i>number</i> change? You, who make all
to a number, as governments do to convicts
in a prison! I tell you, this rage for machinery
will bear Dead Sea fruit. You confound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
man’s highest emotions with the tickling
of the gray matter in his brain; that
way lies death and suicide of the soul&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>We stared; we thought he had gone crazy.</p>

<p>“Goethe and Dante still know more about
this universe than any cipherer,” he said,
more calmly. And then he told us this
story; we fancied it a nightmare, or a morbid
dream; but earnestly he told it, and slowly,
surely, he won our hearts at least to some believing
in the terror of the tale.</p>

<p>When he was through, we parted, with few
words, thinking poor Tetherby mad. But
when he died it was found among his papers,
addressed to me. Materialism had conquered
him, but not subdued him; “say not the
struggle naught availed him” though he left
but this one tract behind. It is only as a
sermon that it needs preserving, though the
story of poor Althea Hardy was, I believe, in
all essentials true.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was born and lived, until I came to this
university, in a small town in Maine. My
father was a graduate of B&mdash;&mdash; College, and
had never wholly dissolved his connection
with that place; probably because he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>there are not unfavorably know to more acquaintances,
and better people, than he elsewhere
found. The town is one of those
gentle-mannered, ferocious-minded, white
wooden villages, common to Maine; with
two churches, a brick town-hall, a stucco lyceum,
a narrow railway station, and a spacious
burying-ground. It is divided into
two classes of society: one which institutes
church-sociables, church-dances, church-sleighing
parties; which twice a week, and
critically, listens to a long and ultra-Protestant,
almost mundane, essay-sermon; and
which comes to town with, and takes social
position from, pastoral letters of introduction,
that are dated in other places and exhibited
like marriage certificates. I have known the
husbands at times get their business employments
on the strength of such encyclicals
(but the ventures of these were not rarely attended
with financial disaster, as passports
only hinder honest travellers); the other
class falling rather into Shakespeare clubs,
intensely free-thinking, but calling Sabbath
Sunday, and pretending to the slightly higher
social position of the two. This is Maine, as
I knew it; it may have changed since. Both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>classes were in general Prohibitionists, but
the latter had wine to drink at home.</p>

<p>In this town were many girls with pretty
faces; there, under that cold, concise sky of
the North, they grew up; their intellects
preternaturally acute, their nervous systems
strung to breaking pitch, their physical
growth so backward that at twenty their
figures would be flat. We were intimate
with them in a mental fellowship. Not that
we boys of twenty did not have our preferences,
but they were preferences of mere
companionship; so that the magnanimous
confidence of English America was justified;
and anyone of us could be alone with her
he preferred from morn to midnight, if he
chose, and no one be the wiser or the worse.
But there was one exceptional girl in B&mdash;&mdash;,
Althea Hardy. Her father was a rich ship-builder;
and his father, a sea-captain, had
married her grandmother in Catania, island
of Sicily. With Althea Hardy, I think, I was
in love.</p>

<p>In the winter of my second year at college
there came to town a certain Dr. Materialismus&mdash;a
German professor, scientist, socialist&mdash;ostensibly
seeking employment as a German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
instructor at the college; practising hypnotism,
magnetism, mesmerism, and mysticism;
giving lectures on Hegel, believing in
Hartmann, and in the indestructibility of
matter and the destructibility of the soul;
and his soul was a damned one, and he cared
not for the loss of it.</p>

<p>Not that I knew this, then; I also was fascinated
by him, I suppose. There was something
so bold about his intellectuality, that
excited my admiration. Althea and I used
to dispute about it; she said she did not like
the man. In my enthusiasm, I raved to her
of him; and then, I suppose, I talked to him
of her more than I should have done. Mind
you, I had no thought of marriage then; nor,
of course, of love. Althea was my most intimate
friend&mdash;as a boy might have been.
Sex differences were fused in the clear flame
of the intellect. And B&mdash;&mdash; College itself
was a co-educational institution.</p>

<p>The first time they met was at a coasting
party; on a night of glittering cold, when the
sky was dusty azure and the stars burned
like blue fires. I had a double-runner, with
Althea; and I asked the professor to come
with us, as he was unused to the sport, and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>feared lest he should be laughed at. I, of
course, sat in front and steered the sled;
then came Althea; then he; and it was his
duty to steady her, his hands upon her
waist.</p>

<p>We went down three times with no word
spoken. The girls upon the other sleds
would cry with exultation as they sped down
the long hill; but Althea was silent. On the
long walk up&mdash;it was nearly a mile&mdash;the professor
and I talked; but I remember only
one thing he said. Pointing to a singularly
red star, he told us that two worlds were
burning there, with people in them; they
had lately rushed together, and, from planets,
had become one burning sun. I asked him
how he knew; it was all chemistry, he said.
Althea said, how terrible it was to think of
such a day of judgment on that quiet night;
and he laughed a little, in his silent way, and
said she was rather too late with her pity,
for it had all happened some eighty years
ago. “I don’t see that you cry for Marie
Antoinette,” he said; “but that red ray you
see left the star in 1789.”</p>

<p>We left Althea at her home, and the professor
asked me down to his. He lived in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>strange place; the upper floor of a warehouse,
upon a business street, low down in
the town, above the Kennebec. He told me
that he had hired it for the power; and I remembered
to have noticed there a sign “To
Let&mdash;One Floor, with Power.” And sure
enough, below the loud rush of the river, and
the crushing noise made by the cakes of ice
that passed over the falls, was a pulsing
tremor in the house, more striking than a
noise; and in the loft of his strange apartment
rushed an endless band of leather,
swift and silent. “It’s furnished by the
river,” he said, “and not by steam. I
thought it might be useful for some physical
experiments.”</p>

<p>The upper floor, which the doctor had
rented, consisted mainly of a long loft for
manufacturing, and a square room beyond it,
formerly the counting-room. We had passed
through the loft first (through which ran the
spinning leather band), and I had noticed a
forest of glass rods along the wall, but massed
together like the pipes of an organ, and opposite
them a row of steel bars like levers.
“A mere physical experiment,” said the doctor,
as we sank into couches covered with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>white fur, in his inner apartment. Strangely
disguised, the room in the old factory loft,
hung with silk and furs, glittering with glass
and gilding; there was no mirror, however,
but, in front of me, one large picture. It
represented a fainting anchorite, wan and
yellow beneath his single sheepskin cloak, his
eyes closing, the crucifix he was bearing just
fallen in the desert sand; supporting him,
the arms of a beautiful woman, roseate with
perfect health, with laughing, red lips, and
bold eyes resting on his wearied lids. I
never had seen such a room; it realized
what I had fancied of those sensuous, evil
Trianons of the older and corrupt world.
And yet I looked upon this picture; and as
I looked, some tremor in the air, some evil
influence in that place, dissolved all my intellect
in wild desire.</p>

<p>“You admire the picture?” said Materialismus.
“I painted it; she was my model.”
I am conscious to-day that I looked at him
with a jealous envy, like some hungry beast.
I had never seen such a woman. He laughed
silently, and going to the wall touched what
I supposed to be a bell. Suddenly my feelings
changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Your Althea Hardy,” went on the doctor,
“who is she?”</p>

<p>“She is not <i>my</i> Althea Hardy,” I replied,
with an indignation that I then supposed
unreasoning. “She is the daughter of a retired
sea-captain, and I see her because she
alone can rank me in the class. Our minds
are sympathetic. And Miss Hardy has a
noble soul.”</p>

<p>“She has a fair body,” answered he; “of
that much we are sure.”</p>

<p>I cast a fierce look upon the man; my eye
followed his to that picture on the wall; and
some false shame kept me foolishly silent.
I should have spoken then.... But
many such fair carrion must strew the path
of so lordly a vulture as this doctor was;
unlucky if they thought (as he knew better)
that aught of soul they bore entangled in
their flesh.</p>

<p>“You do not strain a morbid consciousness
about a chemical reaction,” said he. “Two
atoms rush together to make a world, or
burn one, as we saw last night; it may be
pleasure or it may be pain; conscious organs
choose the former.”</p>

<p>My distaste for the man was such that I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>hurried away, and went to sleep with a
strange sadness, in the mood in which, as I
suppose, believers pray; but that I was
none. Dr. Materialismus had had a plum-colored
velvet smoking-jacket on, with a red
fez (he was a sort of beau), and I dreamed
of it all night, and of the rushing leather
band, and of the grinding of the ice in the
river. Something made me keep my visit
secret from Althea; an evil something, as I
think it now.</p>

<p>The following day we had a lecture on
light. It was one in a course in physics, or
natural philosophy, as it was called in B&mdash;&mdash;
College; just as they called Scotch psychology
“Mental Philosophy,” with capital letters;
it was an archaic little place, and it was
the first course that the German doctor had
prevailed upon the college government to
assign to him. The students sat at desks,
ranged around the lecture platform, the floor
of the hall being a concentric inclined plane;
and Althea Hardy’s desk was next to mine.
Materialismus began with a brief sketch of
the theory of sound; how it consisted in vibrations
of the air, the coarsest medium of
space, but could not dwell in ether; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>how slow beats&mdash;blows of a hammer, for instance&mdash;had
no more complex intellectual
effect, but were mere consecutive noises;
how the human organism ceased to detect
these consecutive noises at about eight per
second, until they reappeared at sixteen per
second, the lowest tone which can be heard;
and how, at something like thirty-two thousand
per second these vibrations ceased to
be heard, and were supposed unintelligible
to humanity, being neither sound nor light&mdash;despite
their rapid movement, dark and silent.
But was all this energy wasted to mankind?
Adverting one moment to the molecular,
or rather mathematical, theory&mdash;first
propounded by Democritus, re-established by
Leibnitz, and never since denied&mdash;that the
universe, both of mind and matter, body and
soul, was made merely by innumerable, infinitesimal
points of motion, endlessly gyrating
among themselves&mdash;mere points, devoid of
materiality, devoid also of soul, but each a
centre of a certain force, which scientists entitle
<i>gravitation</i>, philosophers deem <i>will</i>, and
poets name <i>love</i>&mdash;he went on to Light. Light
is a subtler emotion (he remarked here that he
used the word <i>emotion</i> advisedly, as all emotions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
alike were, in substance, the subjective
result of merely material motion). Light is a
subtler emotion, dwelling in ether, but still
nothing but a regular continuity of motion
or molecular impact; to speak more plainly,
successive beats or vibrations reappear intelligible
to humanity as light, at something
like 483,000,000,000 beats per second in the
red ray. More exactly still, they appear first
as <i>heat</i>; then as red, orange, yellow, all the
colors of the spectrum, until they disappear
again, through the violet ray, at something
like 727,000,000,000 beats per second in the
so-called chemical rays. “After that,” he
closed, “they are supposed unknown. The
higher vibrations are supposed unintelligible
to man, just as he fancies there is no more
subtle medium than his (already hypothetical)
ether. It is possible,” said Materialismus,
speaking in italics and looking at Althea,
“<i>that these higher, almost infinitely rapid
vibrations may be what are called the higher
emotions or passions&mdash;like religion, love and
hate&mdash;dwelling in a still more subtle, but yet
material, medium, that poets and churches
have picturesquely termed heart, conscience,
soul</i>.” As he said this I too looked at Althea.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
I saw her bosom heaving; her lips
were parted, and a faint rose was in her
face. How womanly she was growing!</p>

<p>From that time I felt a certain fierceness
against this German doctor. He had a way
of patronizing me, of treating me as a man
might treat some promising school-boy, while
his manner to Althea was that of an equal&mdash;or
a man of the world’s to a favored lady.
It was customary for the professors in B&mdash;&mdash;
College to give little entertainments to their
classes once in the winter; these usually took
the form of tea-parties; but when it came to
the doctor’s turn, he gave a sleighing party
to the neighboring city of A&mdash;&mdash;, where we
had an elaborate banquet at the principal
hotel, with champagne to drink; and returned
driving down the frozen river, the ice
of which Dr. Mismus (for so we called him
for short) had had tested for the occasion.
The probable expense of this entertainment
was discussed in the little town for many
weeks after, and was by some estimated as
high as two hundred dollars. The professor
had hired, besides the large boat-sleigh,
many single sleighs, in one of which he had
returned, leading the way, and driving with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>Althea Hardy. It was then I determined to
speak to her about her growing intimacy
with this man.</p>

<p>I had to wait many weeks for an opportunity.
Our winter sports at B&mdash;&mdash; used to
end with a grand evening skating party on
the Kennebec. Bonfires were built on the
river, the safe mile or two above the falls was
roped in with lines of Chinese lanterns, and
a supper of hot oysters and coffee was provided
at the big central fire. It was the fixed
law of the place that the companion invited
by any boy was to remain indisputably his
for the evening. No second man would ever
venture to join himself to a couple who were
skating together on that night. I had asked
Althea many weeks ahead to skate with me,
and she had consented. The Doctor Materialismus
knew this.</p>

<p>I, too, saw him nearly every day. He
seemed to be fond of my company; of playing
chess with me, or discussing metaphysics.
Sometimes Althea was present at these
arguments, in which I always took the idealistic
side. But the little college had only
armed me with Bain and Locke and Mill;
and it may be imagined what a poor defence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>I could make with these against the German
doctor, with his volumes of metaphysical realism
and his knowledge of what Spinoza,
Kant, Schopenhauer, and other defenders of
us from the flesh could say on my side.
Nevertheless, I sometimes appeared to have
my victories. Althea was judge; and one
day I well remember, when we were discussing
the localization of emotion or of volition
in the brain:</p>

<p>“Prove to me, if you may, even that every
thought and hope and feeling of mankind is
accompanied always by the same change in
the same part of the cerebral tissue!” cried
I. “Yet that physical change <i>is</i> not the
soul-passion, but the effect of it upon the
body; the mere trace in the brain of its passage,
like the furrow of a ship upon the
sea.” And I looked at Althea, who smiled
upon me.</p>

<p>“But if,” said the doctor, “by the physical
movement I produce the psychical passion?
by the change of the brain-atoms <i>cause</i> the
act of will? by a mere bit of glass-and-iron
mechanism set <i>first</i> in motion, I make the
prayer, or thought, or love, <i>follow</i>, in plain
succession, to the machine’s movement, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>every soul that comes within its sphere&mdash;will
you then say that the metaphor of ship
and wake is a good one, when it is the wake
that <i>precedes</i> the ship?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, smiling.</p>

<p>“Then come to my house to-night,” said
the doctor; “unless,” he added with a sneer,
“you are afraid to take such risks before
your skating party.” And then I saw Althea’s
lips grow bloodless, and my heart
swelled within me.</p>

<p>“I will come,” I muttered, without a smile.</p>

<p>“When?” said the professor.</p>

<p>“Now.”</p>

<p>Althea suddenly ran between us. “You
will not hurt him?” she said, appealingly to
him. “Remember, oh, remember what he
has before him!” And here Althea burst
into a passion of weeping, and I looked in
wild bewilderment from her to him.</p>

<p>“I vill go,” said the doctor to me. “I
vill leafe you to gonsole her.” He spoke in
his stronger German accent, and as he went
out he beckoned me to the door. His sneer
was now a leer, and he said:</p>

<p>“I vould kiss her there, if I vere you.”</p>

<p>I slammed the door in his face, and when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>I turned back to Althea her passion of tears
had not ceased, and her beautiful bright hair
lay in masses over the poor, shabby desk. I
did kiss her, on her soft face where the tears
were. I did not dare to kiss her lips, though
I think I could have done it before I had
known this doctor. She checked her tears
at once.</p>

<p>“Now I must go to the doctor’s,” I said.
“Don’t be afraid; he can do me or my soul
no harm; and remember to-morrow night.”
I saw Althea’s lips blanch again at this; but
she looked at me with dry eyes, and I left
her.</p>

<p>The winter evening was already dark, and
as I went down the streets toward the river I
heard the crushing of the ice over the falls.
The old street where the doctor lived was
quite deserted. Trade had been there in the
old days, but now was nothing. Yet in the
silence, coming along, I heard the whirr of
steam, or, at least, the clanking of machinery
and whirling wheels.</p>

<p>I toiled up the crazy staircase. The doctor
was already in his room&mdash;in the same purple
velvet he had worn before. On his study
table was a smoking supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“I hope,” he said, “you have not supped
on the way?”</p>

<p>“I have not,” I said. Our supper at our
college table consisted of tea and cold meat
and pie. The doctor’s was of oysters, sweetbreads,
and wine. After it he gave me an imported
cigar, and I sat in his reclining-chair
and listened to him. I remember that this
chair reminded me, as I sat there, of a dentist’s
chair; and I good-naturedly wondered
what operations he might perform on me&mdash;I
helpless, passive with his tobacco and his wine.</p>

<p>“Now I am ready,” said he. And he
opened the door that led from his study into
the old warehouse-room, and I saw him touch
one of the steel levers opposite the rows of
glass rods. “You see,” he said, “my mechanism
is a simple one. With all these
rods of different lengths, and the almost infinite
speed of revolution that I am able to
gif them with the power that comes from the
river applied through a chain of belted wheels,
is a rosined leather tongue, like that of a
music-box or the bow of a violin, touching
each one; and so I get any number of beats
per second that I will.” (He always said
<i>will</i>, this man, and never <i>wish</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Now, listen,” he whispered; and I saw
him bend down another lever in the laboratory,
and there came a grand bass note&mdash;a
tone I have heard since only in 32-foot organ
pipes. “Now, you see, it is Sound.” And
he placed his hand, as he spoke, upon a small
crank or governor; and, as he turned it slowly,
note by note the sound grew higher. In the
other room I could see one immense wheel,
revolving in an endless leather band, with
the power that was furnished by the Kennebec,
and as each sound rose clear, I saw the
wheel turn faster.</p>

<p>Note by note the tones increased in pitch,
clear and elemental. I listened, recumbent.
There was a marvellous fascination in the
strong production of those simple tones.</p>

<p>“You see I hafe no overtones,” I heard the
doctor say. “All is simple, because it is mechanism.
It is the exact reproduction of the
requisite mathematical number. I hafe many
hundreds of rods of glass, and then the
leather band can go so fast as I will, and the
tongue acts upon them like the bow upon the
violin.”</p>

<p>I listened, I was still at peace; all this I
could understand, though the notes came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>strangely clear. Undoubtedly, to get a definite
finite number of beats per second was a
mere question of mathematics. Empirically,
we have always done it, with tuning-forks,
organ-pipes, bells.</p>

<p>He was in the middle of the scale already;
faster whirled that distant wheel, and the intense
tone struck C in alt. I felt a yearning
for some harmony; that terrible, simple, single
tone was so elemental, so savage; it racked
my nerves and strained them to unison, like
the rosined bow drawn close against the
violin-string itself. It grew intensely shrill;
fearfully, piercingly shrill; shrill to the rending-point
of the tympanum; and then came
silence.</p>

<p>I looked. In the dusk of the adjoining
warehouse the huge wheel was whirling more
rapidly than ever.</p>

<p>The German professor gazed into my eyes,
his own were bright with triumph, on his lips
a curl of cynicism. “Now,” he said, “you
will have what you call emotions. But, first,
I must bind you close.”</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders amiably, smiling
with what at the time I thought contempt,
while he deftly took a soft white rope and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>bound me many times to his chair. But the
rope was very strong, and I now saw that the
frame-work of the chair was of iron. And
even while he bound me, I started as if from
a sleep, and became conscious of the dull
whirring caused by the powerful machinery
that abode within the house, and suddenly a
great rage came over me.</p>

<p>I, fool, and this man! I swelled and strained
at the soft white ropes that bound me, but in
vain.... By God, I could have killed
him then and there!... And he looked
at me and grinned, twisting his face to fit his
crooked soul. I strained at the ropes, and
I think one of them slipped a bit, for his
face blanched; and then I saw him go into
the other room and press the last lever
back a little, and it seemed to me the wheel
revolved more slowly.</p>

<p>Then, in a moment, all was peace again,
and it was as if I heard a low, sweet sound,
only that there was no sound, but something
like what you might dream the music of the
spheres to be. He came to my chair again
and unbound me.</p>

<p>My momentary passion had vanished.
“Light your cigar,” he said, “it has gone
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>out.” I did so. I had a strange, restful
feeling, as of being at one with the world, a
sense of peace, between the peace of death
and that of sleep.</p>

<p>“This,” he said, “is the pulse of the world;
and it is Sleep. You remember, in the Nibelung-saga,
when Erda, the Earth spirit, is
invoked, unwillingly she appears, and then
she says, <i>Lass mich schlafen</i>&mdash;let me sleep on&mdash;to
Wotan, king of the gods? Some of the
old myths are true enough, though not the
Christian ones, most always.... This
pulse of the earth seems to you dead silence,
yet the beats are pulsing thousands a second
faster than the highest sound.... For
emotions are subtler things than sound, as
you sentimental ones would say; you poets
that talk of ‘heart’ and ‘soul.’ We men of
science say it this way: That those bodily
organs that answer to your myth of a soul
are but more widely framed, more nicely
textured, so as to respond to the impact of a
greater number of movements in the second.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking he had gone into
the other room, and was bending the lever
down once more; I flew at his throat. But
even before I reached him my motive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>changed; seizing a Spanish knife that was
on the table, I sought to plunge it in my
breast. But, with a quick stroke of the
elbow, as if he had been prepared for the
attempt, he dashed the knife from my hand
to the floor, and I sank in despair back into
his arm-chair.</p>

<p>“Yes-s,” said he, with a sort of hiss of
content like a long-drawn sigh of relief.
“Yes-s-s&mdash;I haf put my mechanik quickly
through the Murder-motif without binding
you again, after I had put it back to sleep.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I said, languidly.
How could I ever hope to win Althea away
from this man’s wiles?</p>

<p>“When man’s consciousness awakes from
the sleep of the world, its first motive is
Murder,” said he; “you remember the Hebrew
myth of Cain?” and he laughed silently.
“Its next is Suicide; its third, Despair.
This time I have put my mechanik quickly
through the Murder movement, so your wish
to kill me was just now but momentary.”</p>

<p>There was an evil gleam in his eye as he
said this.</p>

<p>“I leafe a dagger on the table, because if
I left a pistol the subject would fire it, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>that makes noise. Then at the motion of
Suicide you tried to kill yourself: the suicide
is one grade higher than the murderer. And
now, you are in Despair.”</p>

<p>He bent the lever further down and touched
a small glass rod.</p>

<p>“And now, I will gife to you&mdash;I alone&mdash;all
the emotions of which humanity is capable.”</p>

<p>How much time followed, I know not; nor
whether it was not all a dream, only that a
dream can hardly be more vivid&mdash;as this
was&mdash;than my life itself. First, a nightmare
came of evil passions; after murder and suicide
and despair came revenge, envy, hatred,
greed of money, greed of power, lust. I say
“came,” for each one came on me with all the
force the worst of men can feel. Had I been
free, in some other place, I should inexorably
have committed the crimes these evil passions
breed, and there was always some pretext of
a cause. Now it was revenge on Materialismus
himself for his winning of Althea
Hardy; now it was envy of his powers, or
greed of his possessions; and then my roving
eye fell on that strange picture of his I mentioned
before; the face of the woman now
seemed to be Althea’s. In a glance all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>poetry, all the sympathy of my mind or soul
that I thought bound me to her had vanished,
and in their place I only knew desire. The
doctor’s leer seemed to read my thoughts; he
let the lever stay long at this speed, and then
he put it back again to that strange rhythm
of Sleep.</p>

<p>“So&mdash;I must rest you a little between
times,” he said. “Is my fine poet convinced?”</p>

<p>But I was silent, and he turned another
wheel.</p>

<p>“All these are only evil passions,” said I,
“there may well be something physical in
them.”</p>

<p>“Poh&mdash;I can gife you just so well the
others,” he sneered. “I tell you why I do
not gife you all at once&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You can produce lust,” I answered, “but
not love.”</p>

<p>“Poh&mdash;it takes but a little greater speed.
What you call love is but the multiple of lust
and cosmic love, that is, gravitation.”</p>

<p>I stared at the man.</p>

<p>“It is quite as I say. About two hundred
thousand vibrations make in man’s cerebrum
what you call lust; about four billion per second,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
that is gravitation, make what the philosophers
call will, the poets, cosmic love;
this comes just after light, white light, which
is the sum of all the lights. And their multiple
again, of love and light, makes many
sextillions, and that is love of God, what the
priests name religion.”... I think I
grew faint, for he said, “You must hafe some
refreshments, or you cannot bear it.”</p>

<p>He broke some raw eggs in a glass, in
some sherry, and placed it by my side, and I
saw him bend the lever much farther.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” I spoke out, then, “you can
create the emotion, or the mental existence&mdash;whatever
you call it&mdash;of God himself.” I
spoke with scorn, for my mind was clearer
than ever.</p>

<p>“I can&mdash;almost,” he muttered. “Just
now I have turned the rhythm to the thought
millions, which lie above what you call evil
passions, between them and what you call
the good ones. It is all a mere question of
degree. In the eye of science all are the
same; morally, one is alike so good as the
other. Only motion&mdash;that is life; and slower,
slower, that is nearer death; and life is
good, and death is evil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“But I can have these thoughts without
your machinery,” said I.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “and I can cause them
with it; that proves they are mechanical.
Now, the rhythm is on the intellectual-process
movement; hence you argue.”</p>

<p>Millions of thoughts, fancies, inspirations,
flashed through my brain as he left me to
busy himself with other levers. How long
this time lasted I again knew not; but it
seemed that I passed through all the experience
of human life. Then suddenly my
thinking ceased, and I became conscious only
of a bad odor by my side. This was followed
in a moment by an intense scarlet light.</p>

<p>“Just so,” he said, as if he had noted my
expression; “it is the eggs in your glass,
they altered when we passed through the
chemical rays; they will now be rotten.”
And he took the glass and threw it out the
window. “It was altered as we passed
through the spectrum by no other process
than the brain thinks.”</p>

<p>He had darkened the room, but the light
changed from red through orange, yellow,
green, blue, violet; then, after a moment’s
darkness, it began again, more glorious than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>before. White, white it was now, most glorious;
it flooded the old warehouse, and the
shadows rolled from the dark places in my
soul. And close on the light followed Hope
again; hope of life, of myself, of the world,
of Althea.</p>

<p>“Hope&mdash;it is the first of the motions you
call virtuous,” came his sibilant voice, but I
heeded him not. For even as he spoke my
soul was lifted unto Faith, and I knew that
this man lied.</p>

<p>“I can do but one thing more,” said he,
“and that is&mdash;Love.”</p>

<p>“I thought,” said I, “you could make
communion with the Deity.”</p>

<p>“And so I could,” he cried, angrily, “so I
could; but I must first give my glass rod an
infinite rotation; the number of vibrations
in a second must be a number which is a
multiple of <i>all</i> other numbers, however great;
for that even my great fly-wheel must have
an infinite speed. Ah, your ‘loft with power’
does not give me that.... But it
would be only an idea if I could do that too,
nothing but a rhythmic motion in your
brain.”...</p>

<p>Then my faith rose well above this idle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>chatter. But I kept silence; for again my
soul had passed out of the ken of this German
doctor. Althea I saw; Althea in the
dark room before me; Althea, and I had
communion with her soul. Then I knew indeed
that I did love her.</p>

<p>The ecstasy of that moment knew no time;
it may have been a minute or an hour, as we
mortals measure it; it was but an eternity of
bliss to me.... Then followed again
faith and hope, and then I awoke and saw the
room all radiant with the calm of that white
light&mdash;the light that Dante saw so near to God.</p>

<p>But it changed again to violet, like the glacier’s
cave, blue like the heavens, yellow like
the day; then faded through the scarlet into
night.</p>

<p>Again I was in a sea of thoughts and phantasies;
the inspiration of a Shakespeare, the
fancy of a Mozart or a Titian, the study of a
Newton, all in turn were mine. And then my
evil dreams began. Through lust to greed of
power, then to avarice, hatred, envy, and revenge,
my soul was driven like a leaf before
the autumn wind.</p>

<p>Then I rose and flew at his throat once
more. “Thou liest!” I cried. “Heed not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>the rabble’s cry&mdash;God lies NOT in a rotting
egg!”</p>

<p>I remember no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I regained consciousness it was a
winter twilight, and the room was cold. I
was alone in the doctor’s study and the machinery
in the house was stilled.... I
went to the eastern window and saw that the
twilight was not the twilight of the dawn. I
I must have slept all day.... As I
turned back I saw a folded paper on the
table, and read, in the doctor’s hand:</p>

<p>“In six hours you have passed through all
the thoughts, all the wills, and all the passions
known to devils, men, or angels. You
must now sleep deeply or you die. I have
put the lever on the rhythm of the world,
which is Sleep.</p>

<p>“In twelve hours I shall stop it, and you
will wake.</p>

<p>“Then you had better go home and seek
your finite sleep, or I have known men lose
their mind.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I staggered out into the street, and sought
my room. My head was still dizzy, my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>brain felt tired, and my soul was sere. I felt
like an old man; and yet my heart was still
half-drunk with sleep, and enamoured with it,
entranced with that profound slumber of the
world to which all consciousness comes as a
sorrow.</p>

<p>The night was intensely cold; the stars
were like blue fires; a heavy ox-sledge went
by me, creaking in the snow. It was a fine
night for the river. I suddenly remembered
that it must be the night for the skating
party, and my engagement with Althea. And
with her there came a memory of that love
that I had felt for her, sublimated, as it had
been, beyond all earthly love.</p>

<p>I hurried back to my room; and as I lit
the lamp I saw a note addressed to me, in
her handwriting, lying on my study table. I
opened it; all it contained was in two
phrases:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Good-by; forgive me.</p>

<p class="right2">“<span class="smcap">Althea.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>I knew not what to think; but my heart
worked quicker than my brain. It led me to
Althea’s house; the old lady with whom she
lived told me that she had already started for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>the skating party. Already? I did not dare
to ask with whom. It was a breach of custom
that augured darkly, her not waiting for
me, her escort.</p>

<p>On my way to the river I took the street
by the house of Materialismus. They were
not there. The old warehouse was dark in
all its windows. I went in; the crazy
wooden building was trembling with the
Power; but all was dark and silent but the
slow beating of the Power on the Murder
pulse.</p>

<p>I snatched up the Spanish dagger where
it still lay on the table, and rushed out of
that devil’s workshop and along the silent
street to the river. Far up the stream I
could already make out a rosy glow, the fires
and lanterns of the skating party. I had no
skates, but ran out upon the river in a
straight line, just skirting the brink of the
falls where the full flood maned itself and
arched downward, steady, to its dissolution
in the mist. I came to the place of pleasure,
marked out by gay lines of paper lanterns;
the people spoke to me, and some laughed,
as I threaded my way through them; but
I heeded not; they swerving and darting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>about me, like so many butterflies, I keeping
to my line. By the time I had traversed the
illuminated enclosure I had seen all who were
in it. Althea was not among them.</p>

<p>I reached the farthest lantern, and looked
out. The white river stretched broad away
under the black sky, faintly mirroring large,
solemn stars. It took a moment for my eyes,
dazzled by the tawdry light, to get used to
the quiet starlight; but then I fancied that I
saw two figures, skating side by side, far up
the river. They were well over to the eastern
shore, skating up stream; a mile or more
above them the road to A&mdash;&mdash; crossed the
river, in a long covered bridge.</p>

<p>I knew that they were making for that
road, where the doctor doubtless had a sleigh
in waiting. By crossing diagonally, I could,
perhaps, cut them off.</p>

<p>“Lend me your skates,” I said to a friend
who had come up and stood looking at me
curiously. Before he well understood, I had
torn them off his feet and fitted them to my
own; and I remember that to save time I
cut his ankle-strap off with the Spanish
knife. A moment more and I was speeding
up the silent river, with no light but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>stars, and no guide but the two figures that
were slowly creeping up in the shadow of
the shore. I laughed aloud; I knew this
German beau was no match for me in speed
or strength. I did not throw the knife away,
for I meant more silent and more certain
punishment than a naked blow could give.
The Murder motive still was in my brain.</p>

<p>I do not know when they first knew that
I was coming. But I soon saw them hurrying,
as if from fear; at least her strokes
were feeble, and he seemed to be urging, or
dragging her on. By the side of the river,
hitched to the last post of the bridge, I
could see a single horse and sleigh.</p>

<p>But I shouted with delight, for I was already
almost even with them, and could
easily dash across to the shore while they
were landing. I kept to my straight line; I
was now below the last pier of the bridge;
and then I heard a laugh from him, answering
my shout. Between me and the bank
was a long open channel of rippling dark
water, leading up and down, many miles,
from beneath the last section of the bridge.</p>

<p>They had reached the shore, and he was
dragging her, half reluctant, up the bank.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>In a minute, and he would have reached his
horse.</p>

<p>I put the knife between my teeth and
plunged in. In a few strokes of swimming I
was across; but the ice was shelving on the
other side, and brittle; and the strong stream
had a tendency to drag me under. I got my
elbows on the edge of ice, and it broke.
Again I got my arms upon the shelving ice;
it broke again. I heard a wild cry from
Althea&mdash;I cursed him&mdash;and I knew no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I next knew life, it was spring; and
I saw the lilac buds leafing by my window in
the garden. I had been saved by the others&mdash;some
of them had followed me up the
river&mdash;unconscious, they told me, the dagger
still clinched in my hand.</p>

<p>Althea I have never seen again. First I
heard that she had married him; but then,
after some years, came a rumor that she had
not married him. Her father lost his fortune
in a vain search for her, and died. After
many years, she returned, alone. She lives,
her beauty faded, in the old place.</p>

<span class="smaller">ITS SIMPLICITIES AND ITS COMPLEXITIES</span></h2>

<p class="ph2 nobreak">1.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> must</span> first tell you how I came to be ever
a commercial traveller. My father was
a Higginbotham&mdash;one of the Higginbothams
of Salem&mdash;but my mother, Marie Lawrence,
was a far-off cousin of the wife of old Thomas
Lawrence, the great tobacconist of New
York. Horatio Higginbotham was both an
author and an artist, but he neither wrote nor
painted down to the popular taste; and as he
was also a gentleman, and had lived like one,
he left very little money. Not that he took
it with him when he died, but he had spent
it on the way. It costs considerable to get
through this world, if you travel first-class
and pay as you go. And, at least, my father
left no debts.</p>

<p>He left my dear mother, however, and his
assets were represented by me, an expensive
Junior at Newbridge. And as none of
the family counting-rooms and cotton-mills
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>seemed to open the door for me&mdash;so degenerate
a scion of a money-making race as to
have already an artist behind him&mdash;I was glad
to enter the wide portal of Cousin Lawrence’s
tobacco manufactory.</p>

<p>Here, as in most successful trades, you
were, all but the very heir-presumptive, put
through a regular mill. First, a year or two
in the factory, just to get used to the sneezing;
and then you took to the road; and
after a few years of this had thoroughly
taught you the retail trade, you were promoted
to be a gentleman and hob-nob with
the planters in Cuba, and ride over their
landed estates.</p>

<p>I got through the factory well enough; but
the road, as you may fancy, was a trial in
prospect. When my time came (being then,
as you will see, something of a snob) I was
careful to choose the wildest circuit, most
remote from Boston and from Boston ways.
The extreme West&mdash;Denver, Kansas City,
Omaha&mdash;was out of the question; even the
South&mdash;New Orleans, Charleston, Florida
particularly&mdash;was unsafe. Indiana was barbarous
enough, but went with Ohio and
Michigan; and I finally chose what was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>called the Tennessee Circuit, which included
all the country west of the Alleghanies, from
the Ohio River to the Gulf States. Louisville
belonged to my Cincinnati colleague, but the
rest of Kentucky and Tennessee, from the
Cumberland and Great Smoky Mountains to
the hills of Alabama and the plains of Memphis,
were mine.</p>

<p>And by no means uninteresting I found it.
I travelled, you must know, in snuff; and the
Southern mountains, with the headwaters of
the Western rivers, Cumberland, Alabama,
Tennessee, are the country of the snuff-taker
in America.</p>

<p>The civilization, the picturesqueness of our
country lies always between the mountains
and the seaboard. Trace the Appalachian
summits from their first uprearing at Tracadiegash
or Gaspé, to that last laurel-hill
near Tupelo in Mississippi&mdash;on the left of
you lies history, character, local identity; on
the right that great common place, that vast
central prairie, lying stolidly spread out between
the Rockies and the Blue Ridge, producing
food. Heaven keep us above that
central plain, one would say, and from the
men and moods and motives that it breeds&mdash;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
that out of it, in the very unidentified
middle of it, the Lord upreared a Lincoln.</p>

<p>However, my beat lay so well to the south
of it, lurked so far up in the mountain alleyways
and southern river-cañons, that I found
much to study and more to see. The railway
did little more than take me to the field
of labor; the saddle or the wagon or the
country stage must do the rest. My first
trip was to the east of my dominions; my
headquarters were at Knoxville, and from
there I rode through some thousand miles of
mountain and of cove; and different enough
and remote enough it was from all that I had
known before, and from all that might know
me or look askance upon a travelling-merchant
selling snuff by sample. But this was
but a breather, as it were; and on my second
journey I was ordered to replace my predecessor,
Jerry Sullivan, at his headquarters
in Chattanooga, and take entire charge of
that country. Already I had contracted a
prejudice for the slow and unconventional
modes of travelling; and after I had seen
Jerry Sullivan, a genial Irishman, and had
formal delivery of his office, and he had gone
back with evident delight to his beloved New
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>York, and I had sat there alone a day or two,
I thought that I would open out the business
westward. And looking at the map, it occurred
to me that the Tennessee River was
the natural avenue to my domains in that
direction. Luckily, I made the acquaintance
of a young land-prospector, with romantic instincts
like my own; and the second evening
after this idea came to me he and I were
seated in a wooden dug-out canoe, my parcels
of samples and his instruments in the waist
of the boat, drifting swiftly down the brown
stream at sunset, under the lofty shadow of
the Lookout Mountain.</p>

<p>The stream was shallow, and its waters
so opaque that six inches looked like six
fathoms, and it happened not rarely that we
ran upon a sand-bar in full mid-stream; but
a hard shove at the pole would send us off,
usually sideways, careening in the swirl.
When we were not aground our time was
rapid&mdash;some six or seven miles an hour, with
the current, and the pole, and paddle. The
mountains came close around us, and the
shores contracted; and pretty soon the railway
took a plunge into a tunnel and disappeared.
No house nor light was in sight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>when the moon came out. For some twenty
miles or more we swung down the swift
stream silently, in a country that seemed
quite unsettled. And as the night made it
still harder to make out the deeper places, it
is not surprising that after one long, gradual
grate upon a mid-channel sand-bank, we settled
in a bed that all our efforts were insufficient
to dislodge us from. And Arthur Coe,
my companion, by way of making the best
night of it possible, and the moon and the
mild May weather falling in, drew out a banjo
from his traps in the bow and made melodies
not unpleasant to a man who lay silent in the
stern, looking at the stars and smoking his
pipe.</p>

<p>A fine range of trees lined the opposite
shore and, beyond, the forest rolled up in
mountain-shoulders to the sky; but not a
sign of human life was visible. So that we
both started when, at the end of some negro
melody, the refrain was taken up by a lusty
chorus, and rang far out over the murmuring
Tennessee. And in a few moments a large
gum canoe filled with joyous darkies came to
us from the farther shore; and finding our
trouble, nothing would do but they must pull
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>us ashore and we spend the night with
“Massa.” Which we did, and a kind and
queer old pair of gentry we found them, him
and his wife, living alone with a dozen of old
freed slaves, some dozen miles from anywhere.
The old, wide, one-story plantation
house stood in a clearing facing the river
(which used to be much more of a river, with
many steamers and cotton-craft, “befo’ de
wo’”); and we had quite a concert before
we went to bed, with all the cigars and other
accompaniment that we needed. There were
no young people in the house, only old massa
and missus and the old slaves; and we heard
some story of death in battle from the latter,
as we all sang a hymn together before we
went to bed, and took one final glass of
whiskey; and even the negroes were allowed
a taste of something, for wetting their
whistles they had blown so well.</p>

<p>Thus it was, almost every night; and the
long days were spent in drifting down the
river; and even Coe was in no hurry to get
to the place where he was to survey his railway
or prospect his town; and either the
people were so lonely, or their good will was
so great, that they gave orders for snuff in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>a way that was surprising. Only one thing
struck us&mdash;the absence of young people;
not only of young men, but of girls. Coe
said he thought the people were too old to
have any children; but what had become of
the children they should have had twenty
years ago? “War-time,” said Coe, as if
that explained it.</p>

<p>So we got down into Georgia, and then
into Northern Alabama; and the river wound
so that we were two weeks on the way. Coe
was to prospect near a town called Florence,
or Tuscumbia; places that then we never
had heard of.</p>

<p>That day, at dawn, we ran on Muscle
Shoals. Fresh from a night under the wild-grape
vines, blossoming fragrantly, with a
sweetness troubling to the spirit, acrid,
whereunder we had slept like one drugged
with wine&mdash;we had got into our canoe at
sunrise or before, and pushed out into the
stream. It lay broad and still and shimmering&mdash;so
broad that we ought to have noticed
its two or three miles of surface could scarce
cover but three or four inches of depth. But
our eyelids were heavy with the wild grape&mdash;as
if its breath had been some soul phantasm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>of what was to be its fruit&mdash;and so we paddled
dreamily to the midstream and ran aground.</p>

<p>“I say!” said Coe. But there was nothing
to be said, and there we hung, two miles
from either shore, and the sun rose full up
stream, and gilded us.</p>

<p>In all that inland lake was but a hand’s-depth
of water, flowing swift and softly over
sand and shells. We took to our poles; hard
choosing it would be which way lay deepest;
and, one at either end, “Now then!” from Coe;
and we moved, or didn’t move, or for the most
part spun around upon the grinding shells,
and Coe fell out of the boat and splashed
shallowly upon his back upon the sand.</p>

<p>So all that day we labored; and the sun
grew hot, so that Coe at noon sought wading
for the shore to some shelter in the wild
grapes; but that, half a stone’s-throw from
the white clay bank ran swiftly some two
fathoms deep of river Tennessee. So he
came back and swore, and I laughed; and
we set at it again. Meantime the slow, deep-laden
scows, each with an appetizing tent for
shade, spun downward close under that vine-shaded
bank and jeered at us.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, raw-handed from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>poles and raw in visage from a straight-down
sun, we got away. Still breathless, burning,
we too swung down the smooth stream, narrower,
though still a half-mile wide; here it
ran in curves by bold cliff-points castellated
into white, vine-garlanded turrets of the
strangely worn and carven limestone. No
Rhine could be so beautiful; for here all
was unprofaned, silent, houseless, lined by
neither road nor rail.</p>

<p>The sun was nearly setting, and Coe’s soul
turned to beauty, and again he began to marvel
at the want of womankind. No country
was visible behind the river-banks; and he
stood up and studied carefully the shore
through his field-glass.</p>

<p>“I think this is the spot,” he said.</p>

<p>“Tuscumbia?” said I. But Coe was rapt
in study of the river-bank.</p>

<p>“Do you see her?” said I, louder.</p>

<p>Suddenly Coe turned to me in some excitement.
“Paddle hard&mdash;I think it’s the
place.” And seizing his bow paddle he
drove it into the stream so deep that had I
not steadied the craft she had rolled over.
Englishmen can never get used to inanimate
objects; deft is not their word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>So we rounded, always approaching the
shore, a bold promontory; in four successive
terraces three hundred feet of ranged limestone
towers rose loftily, adorned with moss,
and vines, and myrtle-ivy, their bases veiled
in a grand row of gum-trees lining the shore.
No Rheinstein ever was finer, and as we
turned one point, a beautiful rich-foliaged ravine
came down to meet us, widening at the
river to a little park of green and wild flowers,
walled on both sides by the castled cliffs;
in the centre the most unsullied spring I have
ever seen. And all about, no sign of man; no
house, or smoke, or road, or track, or trail.</p>

<p>“This is it,” said Coe again, as the canoe
grated softly on the dazzling sand, and he
prepared to leap ashore.</p>

<p>“What,” said I, “Tuscumbia?” For there
is a legend of this place; and of Tuscumbia,
the great chieftain, and the Indian maiden,
and their trysting by the silent spring.</p>

<p>“No,” said he; “Sheffield. That gorge is
the only easy grade to the river for many
miles. Through it we shall put our railroad,
and this flat will do for terminal facilities&mdash;eh!”
and he leaped clumsily; for the loud
report of a shot-gun broke the air and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>charge whisked almost about our ears, and
flashed a hundred yards behind us in the
Tennessee.</p>

<p>With one accord we ran up the ravine.
There was no path, and the heavy vines and
briers twined about our legs, and the tree-trunks
of the Middle Ages still lay greenly,
but when we sought to clamber over them,
collapsed and let us to their punky middles.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as we rounded a bend between
two gloomy ravages of rock, there stood before
us a young girl, in the green light&mdash;her
hair as black as I had ever seen, with such a
face of white and rose! I stared at her helplessly;
Coe, I think, cowered behind me.
She looked at us inquiringly a moment; and
then, as we neither spoke, turned up the side
of the ravine, with her fowling-piece, and
vanished by some way unknown to us. I
would have followed her, I think, but Coe
held me back by the coat-tails.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” said he. “She’s quite welcome
to a shot, I am sure.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>
<p class="ph2 nobreak">2.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>evertheless</span>, after this one moment
of chivalrous impulse, Coe set up
his levelling-machine and began taking the
gradients of the ravine up which this girl had
gone. I have never known an Englishman
upon whose heart you could make any impression
until his stomach was provided for.
Meantime I wandered on, admiring the red
hibiscus blossom and liana vine that veiled
the gorge in tropical luxuriance up to the
myrtles of the limestone. Finally I emerged
upon the plateau above the river, and found
myself in a glorious, green, flowing prairie,
many miles broad and apparently as long as
the brown Tennessee that lay hid behind me.
In the midst of it one iron-furnace was already
in blast.</p>

<p>The inn (the International Hotel) at Tuscumbia
was very noisy. I was struck by this
when I went to my room to dress for supper;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
I had only been able to get one room
for myself and Coe; there were two beds in
it, but only one wash-stand. Through the
walls, which were very thin, I could hear at
least four distinct feminine voices on the one
side, and several upon the other. There were
also some across the hall that seemed to be
engaged in the same conversation; and that
the speakers were young ladies I had fleeting
but satisfactory evidence when I opened
my door to set out my water-jug for a further
supply.</p>

<p>“Look here, young man,” said the landlord
to me, when I again endeavored to get
another room for Coe. “How many rooms
do you reckon this yer house’ll hold, with
fifty-seven guests all wantin’ em?”</p>

<p>“Fifty-seven!” said I. The International
Hotel was a small two-story wooden house
with a portico. “How many can the hotel
accommodate?”</p>

<p>“Thirty in winter,” said the landlord. “In
summer sixty to seventy.”</p>

<p>I stared at the man until he explained.</p>

<p>“You see, in the winter, they’s most from
the North. I hev accommodated seventy-four,”
added he, meditatively; “but they wuz
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span><i>all</i> Southerners, an’ that wuz befo’ the wo’.
They took a good bar’l of whiskey a day,
they did&mdash;an’ consid’able Bo’bon,” and he
ended with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Your present visitors seem chiefly young
ladies,” I hazarded.</p>

<p>“Hevn’t you heard?” and mine host looked
at me as if to reassure himself as to my social
position. “They is society folks from Knoxville&mdash;down
here givin’ a play&mdash;‘The Pirates
of Penzance,’” and he handed me a newspaper
wherein he pointed to a double-leaded
announcement setting forth that the well-known
Amateur Shakespeare Comedy Club
of Knoxville, consisting of ladies and gentlemen
of the upper social circles of that city,
would appear in this well-known opera, the
article closing with a tribute to the personal
charms of Miss Birdie McClung, the principal
member of the company.</p>

<p>“They hev come down in a Pullman cyar,
all to themselves, quite special,” said the innkeeper.</p>

<p>“Are any of them married, Colonel Kipperson?”
said I, timidly.</p>

<p>The colonel looked at me with scorn; and
just then a peal of rippling laughter, melodious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
as the waves of the Tennessee upon Muscle
Shoals, rang through the thin partition,
accompanied by the crash of some falling
missile, I think, a hair-brush.</p>

<p>“Does that look as if they wuz married?”
said he, and turned upon his heel, as one
who gave me up at last. “Supper’s at six,”
he added, relenting, at the door.</p>

<p>Coe turned up at supper, but we saw nothing
of the fair actresses; and the evening we
passed socially with the leading spirits of
the hotel: Judge Hankinson, Colonel Wilkinson,
General McBride, Tim Healy, the
railroad contractor, and two or three black
bottles. Colonel Wilkinson and General
McBride had been trying a case before
Judge Hankinson, and both were disposed
to criticise the latter’s rulings, but amiably,
as became gentlemen over a whiskey-bottle
in the evening. At midnight, just as the
judge was ordering a fourth bottle, the door
opened, and in walked a very beautiful
young woman with black hair and eyes.
“Good-evening, Miss Juliet,” said the others,
as we rose and bowed.</p>

<p>Miss Juliet walked up to the judge, who
with difficulty got up, and followed her out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>of the room. “Good-night, jedge,” and in
the pause that followed, General McBride
remarked pathetically that “the jedge wasn’t
what he used to wuz.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the colonel, with a sigh, “I’ve
seen the time when he wouldn’t leave a third
bottle of his own.”</p>

<p>“What relation is Miss Juliet to Judge
Wilkinson?” asked Coe.</p>

<p>The general and the colonel started; and
Tim Healy looked apprehensively at the door.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said the general, “I wouldn’t
ask that question, if I wuz you.”</p>

<p>“The jedge ken still shoot,” added the
colonel.</p>

<p>All was forgiven when I had explained
that Mr. Coe was an Englishman; and we
went to bed. About two in the morning the
adjoining rooms became suddenly populous
with soft voices. Coe started to his elbow
in his cot and called to me. “It’s only the
Amateur Shakespeare Comedy Club of Knoxville,
returning from the play,” said I; and
I dropped asleep and dreamed confusedly
of Tuscumbia, the Indian chieftain, feminine
voices, and the rippling waters of the Tennessee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>In the morning I got into the train for
Chattanooga, leaving Coe behind. On the
platform I noticed two graceful girls, dressed
in white muslin, wide straw hats with white
satin ribbon and sashes, white lace mitts, and
thick white veils; not so thick that I could
not see that they were brunettes, with hair
as black as only grows under Southern
nights. The train was composed of two
cars&mdash;the ordinary Southern local&mdash;differing
from a Jersey accommodation only in that it
had still more peanut shells and an added
touch of emigrant-train and circus. At one
end sat a tall gentleman in a stovepipe hat,
who had removed his boots, and was taking
his ease in blue woollen stockings. At the
other was a poor, pretty woman, with large,
sad eyes, petting her emaciated husband,
who was dying of consumption. Just as
the train started, he had a terrible fit of
coughing; now he leans his head upon her
shoulder, and she rests her cheek upon
his forehead. Behind me, but across the
aisle, are the two young ladies in white
muslin.</p>

<p>So we jangle on through the hot Southern
June morning; and pretty soon one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>girls in white comes over and takes the seat
behind me. She has thrown off her veil,
and I assure you a more beautiful face I
never saw; it’s all very well to talk of a neck
like a lily and cheeks like a rose, and eyes</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whose depths unravel the coiled night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And see the stars at noon&mdash;&mdash;”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">but when you really see them you fall down
and worship the aggregation whose inventoried
details, in any novel, would excite weariness.
Meantime, her sister had stretched
herself out upon the other seat, pointing
one dainty russet leather foot beneath the
muslin, and disposed her handkerchief across
her eyes.</p>

<p>How to speak to this fair beauty so close
behind me I know not; I can almost feel her
eyes in the back of my head; so near that I
dare not look round; I fear she may be another
daughter of Judge Wilkinson’s. And
the train jangles on, and we are winding
through green dense forests, up to the mountains.
I wait half an hour for propriety, and
then look around; I catch her deep eyes full,
“bows on,” as it were, her lips parted as if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>almost to speak, and I&mdash;shrink back in confusion.
I hear her give a little sound,
whether a sigh or a murmur I am not sure;
but pretty soon I hear her struggling with
her window. This is my chance; and I rise
and with the politest bow I know and “permit
me,” I seek to help her; but the sash is
old and grimed and the angle inconvenient.
Finally I have to go around into her seat;
and leaning over her I get a purchase and
the window goes up with a bang and a cloud
of dust that sets us both sneezing. “It is
very hot,” I say, standing with my hand upon
her seat, irresolute.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I thought you were never
going to speak?” she says.</p>

<p>I sit down on the seat beside her.</p>

<p>“I hate being unsociable in a railway journey;
but, of course, I couldn’t speak first.
And now there’s so little time left,” she adds,
regretfully.</p>

<p>“Where are you going&mdash;not to Chattanooga?”</p>

<p>“Only to Scott’s Plains. What’s your
name?”</p>

<p>“Horatio Higginbotham,” I have to reply,
fearing she will laugh, though the name is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>well known in Salem. She does not laugh
at all, but smiles divinely.</p>

<p>“My name is Jeanie Bruce. And that’s
my sister May. Come over, and I’ll introduce
you.”</p>

<p>We walk across the car and Miss Jeanie
says to Miss May (who, it appears, is not
asleep), “May, I want to introduce to you
my friend, Mr. Higginbotham. Mr. Higginbotham,
Miss May Bruce.”</p>

<p>I bow to the more languid beauty, who
does not rise, but smiles a twin sister of
Miss Jeanie’s smile, showing her little white
teeth and tapping her little foot in a way to
make a man distracted which to look at.</p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t seem to be getting
on very well,” says the recumbent May, “but
now, I suppose, I can go to sleep,” and she
pulls the lace handkerchief back over her
eyes, and Jeanie leads me (it is the word)
back to our seat on the other side of the car.
“We are twin sisters; and some people can’t
tell one from the other. Could you?” And
she takes off her hat, pushes the soft black
mass back from her brow, and looks at me,
frankly, sweetly.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t want to,” I say. I think I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>am getting on; but she looks at me as if
puzzled, half displeased.</p>

<p>“May is engaged,” she answers, “and I
am not. I have been, though.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” I answer, heedlessly; “how
old&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Seventeen. But I never had a gen’leman
ask me such a question before.”</p>

<p>She is silent; I speechless. Yet I wish
she would pronounce the t in “gentleman.”
She does not bear malice long, but asks
“where I come from?”</p>

<p>“Boston,” I say; “and <i>I</i> am twenty-three.”</p>

<p>She laughs merrily, in forgiveness, with
a dear, lovable, quick sense of humor. Then
she scans me curiously. “I never saw a
gen’leman from Boston before.”</p>

<p>“There are some there,” I answer, humbly.</p>

<p>“Of course we see plenty of commercial
travellers,” she says, and the conversation
languishes. I look out the window, for suggestions,
at the tall mountain timber and the
bearded gray moss. It suggests nothing but
partridges.</p>

<p>“But you have not yet told me whether
you can tell us apart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Thus challenged, I bring my eyes to hers;
there is something dazzling about them that
always makes it hard to see her face, except
when she is looking away; my eyes wander
not from hers, until she does look away&mdash;out
the window&mdash;and I suddenly see something
familiar in the face.</p>

<p>“Is there much shooting about here?” I
ask, abruptly, meaning game.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a terrible deal. Why, my
cousin, Kirk Bruce, was only eighteen when
he shot and killed another gen’leman at
school.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, I didn’t mean men,” I say. “I
meant quail and partridges. And I thought
I had seen you yesterday with a shot-gun
down in that green bottom by the Tennessee.
It might have been men, though; for your
shot whistled about the ears of my friend,
Mr. Coe.”</p>

<p>“I wondered you didn’t remember me when
you got upon the train,” answers Jeanie.
“Where is Mr. Coe?”</p>

<p>“He stayed behind at Sheffield,” I say.
“Do you belong to the ‘Pirates of Penzance’?”</p>

<p>“Mercy, no&mdash;they’re city people from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>Knoxville&mdash;we’ve only spent two winters
there getting our education in music.”</p>

<p>“Is Knoxville a musical city?”</p>

<p>“The advantages there are considered exceptional.
We were at the Convent of Sacré-Cœur.”</p>

<p>“At the convent?” I ask.</p>

<p>“All our best schools are the convents, you
know, for us girls. At Sacré-Cœur we have
instruction from Signor Mancini. I have
learned seventeen pieces, but May knows
twenty-four and two duets.”</p>

<p>“Sonatas?” I say. “Concertos? Chopin?
Beethoven?”</p>

<p>Miss Bruce shakes her head. “No,” she
answers, with some pride. “Our music is
<i>all</i> operatic. Of course, I can play ‘The
Monastery Bells’ and ‘The Shepherd’s
Dream;’ but now I’m learning ‘Il Trovatore.’
My sister can play a concert-piece
upon ‘La Cenerentola.’”</p>

<p>“What else do you learn?”</p>

<p>“French&mdash;and dancing&mdash;and embroidery.
But I suppose you are terribly learned,” and
Miss Jeanie takes a wide and searching gaze
of my poor countenance with her beautiful
soft eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“Not at all. I am a commercial traveller,”
I say to justify my blushes. It was
malicious of me; for she looks pained.</p>

<p>“Nearly all <i>our</i> young gen’lemen have got
to go into business since the war. My cousin
Bruce&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>(There was an inimitable condescension in
her accent of the “our.”)</p>

<p>“The one who shot the other boy at
school? Don’t you think you have too
much of that kind of shooting?”</p>

<p>“As a gen’leman he had to do it&mdash;in self-defence.
Of course, they were both very
<i>young</i> gen’lemen. The other gen’leman had
his revolver out first.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to carry revolvers so
much.”</p>

<p>“There! that’s just what I’ve often said.
But how can you help it?”</p>

<p>“I help it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say you haven’t so much as a
pistol with you?” And her gentle eyes are
so full open that in looking into them I forget
my answer.</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, it wasn’t Cousin Kirk’s
fault. He didn’t have any revolver, either,
when he first went out of the house; but another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
scholar he ran up and made him take
one. Mother didn’t ever want him to go to
that school, anyhow; several of our family
had got shot there before by this other boy’s
family. This other boy, you see, liked a
young lady Cousin Kirk was attentive to;
and he sent word in to him one day to come
out of the school-house to see him. And the
other young gen’lemen in the school, they
warned Cousin Kirk not to see him, as he
wasn’t armed. He’d never ought to have
gone out unarmed. But he went. And as
soon as they met he shot Cousin Bruce in
the right arm. And a friend that was with
him gave Cousin Bruce his pistol; and he
had to fire; and he killed him; and Cousin
Bruce always says that man’s face haunts
him yet. And the mother of the young man
was almost crazy; and afterward she called
at the school with a revolver, dressed in deep
mourning. And when Cousin Bruce came
into the parlor he didn’t know who she was;
and she shot at him through the crape veil.
But, of course, she didn’t hit him. And
Cousin Bruce always says that man’s face
haunts him yet.”</p>

<p>(I have endeavored to set down this conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
just as it happened. At the time
I did not know at all what to make of Miss
Jeanie Bruce. I had seen no girls like her
in Salem, or even Boston. Her English was
poor, her education deficient, her manners
free. On all these points she was about on
a par with the shop-girls in Lynn. But she
was not at all like a Lynn shop-girl. Had I
supposed it possible for there to be any
ladies except according to the Salem and
Boston standards, I should have set her
down for a lady at the time.)</p>

<p>Here we arrived at Decatur, where I had
the pleasure of taking the two Misses Bruce
in to dinner, in a hotel built alongside of the
railroad track, as the principal street of the
town. In the long dining-room were six
transverse tables, over everyone of which
was a huge wooden fan like the blade of a
paddle. The six fans were connected together,
and at the back of the room a small
bare-footed negro swung the entire outfit to
and fro by means of a long pole like a boat-hook;
and with a great swish! swish! disturbed
in regular oscillations the clouds of
flies. Miss Jeanie took off the lace mitts
at the dinner-table, and upon one forefinger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
of her pretty white hand I noticed a
ring&mdash;a single band of gold setting a small
ruby.</p>

<p>When we got back into the cars and May
had gone to sleep again, I reproached Jeanie
with telling me she was not engaged. “I,
too, was going to spend this winter at Knoxville,
and I had hoped to see something of
you.”</p>

<p>“I am not engaged,” said Miss Jeanie.
“The ring was given me by a gen’leman, but
I do not care for him at all. I only promised
to wear it a few weeks, because he bothered
so. I’ll tell you what,” she said, “to show I
don’t care for him and remind you to be sure
and call, I’ll give it to you.”</p>

<p>I was in some surprise, you may suppose.
“But I can’t take a gentleman’s
ring&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s my ring, I tell you,” said Miss Jeanie.
“And if you don’t take it, I shan’t believe
you’re coming to see me, and I won’t give
you my address&mdash;there!”</p>

<p>What could I do? I took the ring.</p>

<p>When I got that night to Knoxville, I
wrote at once to Jerry Sullivan. If they had
spent two winters in Knoxville, he might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>have met them, or, at least, known something
about them.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p class="right2">“<span class="smcap">Knoxville</span>, June 30, 188&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span> had</span> deferred my call upon Miss Bruce
until I should receive Sullivan’s answer to
my letter; but when his telegram came I was
in a quandary. It struck me as ambiguous.
And what could be the extreme haste that
made a telegram advisable? Or, perhaps,
was the whole thing only one of Jerry Sullivan’s
jokes?</p>

<p>Meantime I was wearing Miss Jeanie
Bruce’s ring. Once it struck me that if I
did not mean to call upon her, I ought to
send it back. But I did mean to call upon
her. There never was any question about
that, from the first. I did not in the least
approve of her, but I meant to call upon her,
if only to tell her so. Her conversation had
revealed a certain indifference to human life,
but she had very soft and gentle eyes. Like
the face of the boy whom Cousin Kirk had
shot, they “haunted me yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Coe noticed my ring. Oddly enough,
though a foreigner, he had got into the ways
of the people quicker than I had; and I saw
him looking at it one day, though he said
nothing. That is, nothing of the ring; he
did ask me whether I had been to see Miss
Bruce. So I went; they boarded in a small
frame house that belonged to a Mrs. Judge
Pennoyer. I suspect it was this female justice
who came to the door; it was a Monday
afternoon and the house was odorous with
soup; but Miss Jeanie was “very much engaged.”
The Friday following she was out,
and Wednesday I met her walking on the principal
street of Knoxville with a tall young man.</p>

<p>“Try Saturday,” said Coe that evening.
“I want you to ask those girls for my trip
up over the line.” During the summer, Coe
had got some rusty rails spiked upon his
right of way; and now wished to invite the
youths and ladies of Tennessee to run over
them in a trial trip.</p>

<p>That day I found Miss Jeanie alone in the
parlor, almost as if awaiting me. “I began
to think you had forgotten us,” said she,
softly. Dear me, how soft her eyes were! I
said that I had called there many times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“You could scarcely expect me to let you
in when another gen’leman was here!” said
she. “Especially when&mdash;&mdash;” I saw her look
at the ring; but she checked herself. My afternoon
calls in Salem had not so exclusively
monopolized the lady’s attention, and I
looked at her, puzzled. Just then the front
door-bell rang; and I was confident I heard
Mrs. Judge Pennoyer tell someone that Miss
Jeanie “was very much engaged.”</p>

<p>My conversation languished. I think that
Miss Bruce was disappointed. “Shall I
play to you?” I saw her hesitate between
“The Shepherd Boy” and a romance of
Brinley Richards; and I hastened to reply,
“I would rather talk.”&mdash; “But you don’t
talk,” cried she. “But I look.”&mdash; “You can
look while I play.”&mdash; “Not so well,” said I.&mdash; “I
have a new piece&mdash;one they sent me
from the convent, the Sacré-Cœur, you know,
where I was for some years. It is called the
‘Tears of Love.’ The musical instruction of
the convent was very good. Sister Ignatia
had studied in Italy. I suppose it was better
than outside&mdash;don’t you?”</p>

<p>I had never studied in a convent, and I
don’t think I made much answer, for she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>went on. “Of course, you know, it is
pleasanter in other ways. One has so much
more liberty. Yet the most Kentucky ladies
are all educated in convents. But I felt that
I wished to see more of society. At the
Sacré-Cœur they do not allow you to receive
your gen’lemen friends except in the presence
of the mother superior.”</p>

<p>There was a freshness, a simplicity of
method in this young lady’s playing with the
boys that quite took my breath away, and to
relieve the situation I deemed it best to submit
to the “Tears of Love.” Of this piece
of music I remember little, save that the
composer was continually bringing the left
hand over the right to execute unnecessary
arpeggios in the treble notes. Jeanie’s girlish
figure was so round, and swayed so easily,
that I thought this part of the music very
pretty.</p>

<p>Then I bethought myself of the object of
my visit; and I invited Miss Jeanie and Miss
May, on Mr. Coe’s behalf, to make the railroad
trip. A Salem instinct made me include
Mrs. Judge Pennoyer; I then saw in
Miss Bruce’s look that it had been unnecessary.
Only when I got out the door did I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>remember that the ring had, after all, been
my main object; to return it, I mean.</p>

<p>On the other side of the street, along by a
low white-painted paling, lowered a heavy,
hulking fellow in a rusty black frock-coat, a
great deal of white shirt, and a black clerical
tie. In this garb I recognized the Southern
University man, and in the man I had a premonition
I saw the redoubtable “Cousin
Kirk.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">C</span>oe</span> was chartered by the sovereign States
of Florida and Alabama to construct his
line “from that part of the Atlantic Ocean
called the Gulf of Mexico, in the former State,”
to a point “at or near” the Tennessee River
in the latter. And so “a point at or near the
Tennessee River” was the first object of our
journey, and this proved as definite a designation
as we could give it; though it had
public parks and corner lots and a name&mdash;on
paper. Its name in reality was “Cat Island,”
the only native settlement being on a beautifully
wooded island thus called, midstream in
the river.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t do to call it that, you know,”
said Coe, in a burst of frankness. “Famous
place for chills and fever; everybody born on
Cat Island, white or black, turns clay-color!
So we thought of Bagdad&mdash;from its resemblance
to the Euphrates.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Judge Pennoyer had come; but so
had a strange young man whose name I found
was Raoul. He devoted himself to Miss
May with a simplicity of purpose amazing to
a Northern mind. Hardly anyone knew of
the expedition at Knoxville, but when we
arrived at Bagdad, that spacious plain was
peopled in a way to delight the speculator.
“Who are they?” I asked of Coe, puzzled
at his evident anxiety where I expected pride.
“Who are they, O Caliph of Bagdad?”</p>

<p>“Who are they? The Mesopotamians.
Dash it,” he added, “they’ve come, with their
wives and children, for the trip.”</p>

<p>So, indeed, they had. Tim Healy met us
as we alighted on the platform of the old
railroad station&mdash;there was, indeed, a platform,
but nothing more&mdash;and grasping Coe
and me warmly by the hand, said rapidly, in
the latter’s ear, “had to invite a few of them,
you know&mdash;prominent gen’lemen of the neighborhood&mdash;valuable
political influence”&mdash;and
then, aloud, “General McBride, gen’lemen.
Mrs. McBride. Judge Hankinson I think
you know. Mr. Coe, I want you fo’ to know
Senator Langworthy; one of our most prominent
citizens, gen’lemen, an’ I had the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>grea-at-est difficulty in persuading the senator
fo’ to come along. I told him, Mr. Coe, we
could show him something of a railroad already&mdash;&mdash;”
Coe expressed his acknowledgments.</p>

<p>“Sir, it was a pleasure to study the developments
of my country. It does not need to
be a citizen of Bagdad to appreciate the advantages
of your location,” and the senator
waved his hand in the direction of a rusty
line of track I then first perceived winding
across the prairie from the Tennessee. “Let
me introduce to you Mrs. Langworthy.” A
pale lady, with bonnet-strings untied and a
baby at the breast, was indicated by the
second gesture; she looked worn and world-weary,
but I lived to learn she had an endurance
of hardship Stanley might have envied,
and a relish for fried cakes and bacon in
the small hours of night that I am sure only
an optimist could feel. “My partner, Mr.
Hanks. My wife’s sister, Miss McClung.”</p>

<p>By this time we were ready to start. A
brand-new locomotive decorated with flowers
had backed down awkwardly from the new-laid
track to the junction; and we entered
what Coe with some pride informed me was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>the directors’ car. It contained one long
saloon, two staterooms, a minute kitchen,
and a glass gallery behind.</p>

<p>It was amazing how we all got into it; and
when we had, I counted three babies, seven
old women, and a dog, besides some twenty
men. All had brought their luncheon-baskets,
and the babies (except that appertaining
unto Mrs. Senator Langworthy) were
consoled with bottles. After a prodigious
deal of whistling, we were off, and Bagdad
resumed its quietude&mdash;at least, we thought
so; but even then a distant shouting was
heard, and Colonel Wilkinson, his wife, and
two urchin boys were descried, hastening
down the track from the direction of the
Bagdad Hotel. Judge Hankinson pulled the
bell-cord and then thrust his head out of a
window and roared to the engineer. “Stop,
driver, it’s Colonel Wilkinson. How are you,
colonel?” he added to that gentleman, who
had arrived, and was mopping himself with a
red silk handkerchief, his wife and offspring
still some laps behind. “Almost thought
you’d be left.”</p>

<p>“Great heavens, I wish he was!” groaned
Coe in my ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind, the judge hasn’t brought
Miss Julia,” said Tim Healy; and this time
we were really off.</p>

<p>I have neither time nor memory to describe
that day; though it was very funny
while it lasted, perhaps all the funnier that
there was no one to share the humor of it.
Everybody was great on the development of
the country, and everybody made speeches.
We stopped at least twenty times in the first
fifteen miles to look at a seam of coal, or a
field of iron, or a marble quarry (suitable for
the Alhambra Palace or the new State Capitol,
sir), or, at least, one of the most wonderful
mineral springs of the world&mdash;only
waiting the completion of Colonel Coe’s line
of railroad to become another Saratoga. At
all these places we got off the train, and went
in a long, straggling, irregular file to inspect,
Mrs. Senator Langworthy ruthlessly interrupting
the repast of her youngest-born at
such moments, and leaving him upon a car-seat
in charge of the fireman. At the quarry
or mineral spring the proprietor would take
his turn in making a little stump speech,
standing on the edge and gesticulating into
the pool, while the rest of us stood grouped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>around the margin. Meantime Miss May
Bruce and Raoul would go to walk in the
woods; and we would hear the engine whistling
wildly for us to return. It was a novel
interruption to a flirtation, that railway-whistle;
but everybody looked upon us amiably
as we hurried down to the track; live
and let live, and take your time for happiness;
no schedule time, as at Salem.</p>

<p>By the hot noon we were above the river
valley and winding up the folds of fir-forest
that clothed the shaggy shoulders of
the mountain. Engine No. 100 puffed and
strained, and reeled up before us like a
drunken man. We had had our dinner; the
sexes began to separate, and even the Langworthy
baby went to sleep. Raoul and May
were riding on the engine. I left Miss Jeanie
Bruce and joined the gentlemen, who were
sitting cross-legged and contented in the
smoking end of the car, from the glass-housed
platform of which we looked already back
upon the great central plain from the rising
Appalachians.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a glorious country,” said “Colonel”
Coe; and, I think, winked at me.</p>

<p>“Why, senator,” said the judge, “I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>seen a corner-lot sold at Bagdad six times
in one day, ’n a thousan’ dollars higher every
time.”</p>

<p>“General,” said the senator, “do you know
what the original purchase of the Bagdad
Land and Investment Company aggregated&mdash;for
the whole eighteen hundred acres?”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Everybody looked at
me. It dawned upon me that I was the
“general,” and I wondered why I ranked
poor Coe.</p>

<p>“I’ve no idea,” I hastened to add; fearing
the senator had followed Coe’s wink.</p>

<p>“Thirty thousand dollars,” answered General
McBride, as if it were a game of “School-teacher.”
“And they sold three hundred
acres for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fifteen hundred thousand dollars,” resumed
Judge Hankinson, with intense solemnity.</p>

<p>“Paper?” said Tim Healy.</p>

<p>“Cash, Captain Healy,” said the judge,
fiercely, “cash.”</p>

<p>“I want to know!&mdash;Was that the lot you
bought of Widow Enraghty, judge?”</p>

<p>A roar of laughter greeted Tim’s answer.
People tipped back their chairs, slapping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>their thighs; the Langworthy baby woke up
and cried, and even the judge screwed up his
whiskey-softened old face in vain.</p>

<p>“Tell us about it, judge,” said Raoul, who
had come back from the engine and was peering
over our shoulders. “I’m a young lawyer,
and I want to know these tricks.”</p>

<p>“Young man,” said the judge, “I’ll <i>tell</i>
you, and let it be a warning to you when
you’re married, to be honest and say so”
(Raoul blushed violently). “The fact was,
I had been acquainted with the widow Enraghty
more than fifty years&mdash;her husband
had got killed in the forties, an’ she was
sixty-five if she was a day, and she owned
that valuable corner lot opposite the new
Court-house and by the building of the Board
of Trade.” (“Not built yet,” whispered Coe
to me.) “I’d been dickering with her for
weeks; but I stood at four thousand, and she
wanted five. Now I rode up that morning (it
was a fine day; warm and spring-like, and I
felt rather sanguine) and I said, ‘What’s
your price, Mrs. Enraghty, to-day?’ ‘Six
thousand,’ said she. This raise made me
kind o’ nervous, an’ I got rash. ‘I’ll give
you three thousand,’ said I, ‘cash.’ ‘Here’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>your deed,’ says Widow Enraghty. And I
declare she had it all ready. I looked at it
carefully; it seemed all right, and I paid her
the money. I kinder noticed there was a
young fellow sittin’ in the room. Well, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well, judge?” The judge’s manner grew
impressive.</p>

<p>“Next week that young fellow&mdash;Bill Pepper
he was, an’ he was just twenty-one&mdash;he
brought an ejectment against me. <i>She had
married him that morning.</i> So Bill Pepper
kep’ the land, and Mrs. Pepper kep’ the
money.”</p>

<p>In the laughter that followed I became
conscious of Raoul pinching my arm mysteriously.
“I want a word with you in private,”
said he. “Would you mind coming out
upon the cow-catcher? It’s been railed off
on purpose for observation,” he added, answering
my look of amazement, “and it’s a
first-rate place to see the cobweb trestle from.
It’s something about the young ladies,” he
added, seeing that I still hesitated, “and
there’s really no other place.”</p>

<p>I looked through the car, but perceived
the ladies were sitting in earnest conclave.
On the front platform Mrs. Langworthy and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>the baby were taking the air. In the cab of
the engine were the two girls. I suppose I
made a gesture of assent, for Raoul nodded
to the engineer, who slowed to a halt that almost
threw the Langworthy’s domestic group
into the bed of a brawling mountain stream
some three hundred feet below.</p>

<p>“These gen’lemen want to ride on the
pilot,” shouted the engineer in explanation;
and we took our way to that exalted perch,
where, sitting cross-legged and with hands
nervously gripping the rail, I listened to
Raoul’s story.</p>

<p>The Misses Bruce, he said, were wild not
to go back that day with the railroad party,
but to drive to the end of the location through
the woods.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens!” said I, “but only Coe
and I are going, with Captain Healy. There
is nothing but tents&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The ladies are used to camping out.”</p>

<p>“But it will be so rough&mdash;there are two
thousand niggers in camp!”</p>

<p>“The ladies are not afraid.”</p>

<p>I certainly was; for just then, with a preliminary
corkscrew-like lurch, the engine began
climbing the famous cobweb trestle; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>earth suddenly vanished beneath us and we
looked down through a lath-like tracery of
wooden girders to the foaming stream, now
four hundred feet below. I heard a cry behind,
and looking timidly around, I saw the
pale face of Jeanie at one engine-window and
of May Bruce at the other.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but there is no chaperone,” I
gasped.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Judge Pennoyer has agreed to
come,” answered Mr. Raoul, sweetly.</p>

<p class="ph2 nobreak">5.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> end of our journey lay upon the very
summit of the mountain ridge; twenty
leagues of forest all around. Here, with the
sweep of his gesture to the westering sun,
Judge Hankinson made the great speech of
the day. I remember little about it save
that he likened Coe to Icarus, referred to
me (General Higginbotham) as one of the
merchant princes of the Orient, and to Tim
Healy as some mighty magician “spinning
his iron spell o’er mountain and o’er sea.”
The rusty iron rails stopped abruptly in a
field of stumps; beyond and below us
stretched “the right of way.” Only a broad
swath cut through the forest, the trees heaped
where they fell, like jack-straws. At the
edge of the clearing stood a three-seated
wagon and a pair of mules.</p>

<p>Everyone took very simply to the proposition
that we were not returning; and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
all the speech-making was over and all
the whiskey drunk, the train, with prolonged
and reiterated tooting, began backing slowly
down the mountain toward civilization again.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this delightful?” said Miss Jeanie.
Tim Healy sniffed.</p>

<p>I had made it all right with Coe; but
Healy still looked at the proceeding askance.</p>

<p>“Last time I rode through this yer wood
I had the pay-chest with me; and two bullets
went through my hat. And last week
they killed the United States mail and Jim,
the storekeeper of Section Fourteen.”</p>

<p>I considered this to be a story for tender-feet,
so I mildly hinted that “they” would
not attack so large a party.</p>

<p>“Won’t they, though? The only double
mule team as ever goes through yer is the
month’s pay, an’ hit’s jest due this Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Who is ‘they’?” said I.</p>

<p>“Moonshiners. But they’re all on ’em up
to it. Hope you’ve got your shooters?”</p>

<p>By this time we had started, and were
driving through the twilight of the forest
over a trail hardly perceptible where the
wood grew scantier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“Not I,” said I, “I never carry them.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Coe, “I left ’em on the bureau
at home.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Tim, gloomily. “But
most fellers like a shot of their own afore
they turn their toes up.”</p>

<p>Miss Jeanie produced a small, pearl-handled,
silver-mounted revolver, and begged me
to borrow it. Miss May handed the mate of
it to Coe; and young Raoul displayed a formidable
pair of Smith &amp; Wesson’s, where he
was sitting with her on the back seat.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Tim, somewhat mollified.
“But the wood’s chock full of chickers all
the same.”</p>

<p>At this the ladies appeared really so terrified
that I asked what “chickers” were, and
discovered them to be a kind of insect.</p>

<p>“I’ve got my pennyr’yle,” said Mrs. Judge
Pennoyer, who was a woman of resource.</p>

<p>What a drive it was! We lost our way;
and the girls sang. Tim swore, Mrs. Judge
Pennoyer laughed, and May and Jeanie sang
all the sweeter. Tim Healy thought he saw
twenty moonshiners and emptied his revolver
at one of them; a charred stump it
proved to be. We passed one hut in a clearing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and were refreshed by veritable whiskey;
<i>i.e.</i>, “pine-top” whiskey, milky-white in color,
and said to be made out of the cones of
pines. We found the trail once more and
the stars came out, and the nightingales sang,
and May Bruce and young Raoul became
more silent. At last we saw, upon a hillside
in the forest, the burning pitch-pine torches
of the great construction “camp.” Hundreds
of black forms surrounded these ruddy
fires; from some of the groups came sounds
of banjos and negroes singing; and I looked
suddenly up and saw the starlight reflected
in Miss Jeanie’s eyes.</p>

<p>There was only one tent in the camp with
“sides” to it&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, perpendicular flaps making
walls below the roof, and that, of course,
was sacred to the ladies. We lay beneath
a mere <b>V</b>-shaped canvas roof, which was
stretched downward so as to end some three
feet from the ground, our heads in a heap of
pillows, and our legs all radiating outward,
like a starfish, to terminate in thirty booted
feet. Under the canvas back I could see the
starlight, and there I lay awake some time
regarding it, which now seemed to bear some
reflection of Miss Jeanie’s eyes. Next thing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>came the sun and opened mine by shining
into them; then closed them up again, and I
rolled into the canvas-shade, and up, and out
of doors, and followed Coe and Healy to the
“branch” below. Big Bear Creek it was, of
a rich red-chocolate color, fit, perhaps, to wash
a Chinaman who could not see. Yet Coe
took a plunge, and looked up, white enough.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he shouted to us, who were
hesitating, “it doesn’t come off.”</p>

<p>The negroes had been sleeping all over the
place, tentless; and now they were pulling
themselves together, in groups, and starting
for the railroad, or rather where the railroad
was to be. On the way they stopped at the
commissaries’ to get their breakfast, standing
in long rows before the counter, waiting their
turn. The commissaries’ stores were the
only wooden buildings in camp; well walled
and bolted, too, as they had to be, said Tim
Healy, to withstand the attacks of a riotous
Saturday night. Four men, he said, were
always in them armed; and on Saturday
nights, pay-night, they would often empty a
revolver or two into the crowd and perhaps
“drop” a nigger, before it ceased to besiege
their doors for fruit or whiskey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>Then we all went to breakfast, the Misses
Bruce both fresh as dewy wood-flowers, and
Mrs. Judge Pennoyer radiating amiability.
Only the head commissary and the section
contractor were thought of sufficient social
importance to breakfast with us, and the
former from his stores brought many delicacies
in cans and bottles. Then after breakfast
we went to walk&mdash;the ladies with sunshades
and gloves&mdash;upon the location; a
broad swath cut through the rolling forest
and undulating far as the eye could reach in
either direction, dotted with men and mules.
Ahead, they were still blowing out stumps
with gunpowder and dragging them away;
where we stood was being built an embankment
of gravel; and they were dragging out
gravel from the “cut” ahead and heaping it
upon the long mound. I gave my hand to
Miss Jeanie and helped her up. Each black
negro worked with a splendid mule; seventeen
or eighteen hands high perhaps, dragging
a curious sort of drag-spade, which the
mule knew how to catch in the gravel, turn
out full, drag the load evenly along, and then
tip it out adroitly at the precise spot, a foot
in front of the last dump; the negro hardly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>doing more than standing by to see the mule
kept working; not, of course, working himself.
Thus each man-laborer became an
overseer, if only to a mule.</p>

<p>“The mule’s the finer animal of the two,”
said Coe, “and much the more moral.”</p>

<p>“But he’s got no vote,” grunted Jim. “Ef
we didn’t keep them black Mississippi niggers
up here off’m the farms, they’d swamp
us all.”</p>

<p>“Are they allowed to bring their wives to
camp with them?” queried Miss Jeanie, softly;
and, following her glance, we saw several
coal-black damsels sitting in the warm sand-bank
at the side of the cut, their finery about
them, and evidently established there for the
morning, basking in the sun.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they bring up their wives,” said
Healy, reluctantly. “If we didn’t, they’d run
away every two or three days. Nothing a
contractor dislikes so much as irregular labor.”</p>

<p>“But it shows they have some good in
them to be so devoted,” said Miss Jeanie.</p>

<p>“We don’t all of us have emotions stronger
than money-getting,” added I.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about emotions,” said Tim.
“There’s forty of their wives and eighteen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>hundred niggers, and every Saturday night
they has a fight an’ a batch on ’em gets
killed, an’ I know it’s terrible expensive on
labor. Most as bad as moonshine.”</p>

<p>“Have you got King Kelly, yet?” said
Coe, in an undertone.</p>

<p>“Hush!” hissed Captain Healy, dramatically.
Just then I noticed a file of peculiarly
idle negroes sauntering down the “right
of way;” they had passed us once or twice
before, and appeared to have no occupation.
“See anythin’ peculiar about them niggers?”</p>

<p>“They are very lazy,” said Coe.</p>

<p>“They look like minstrels,” said Miss Jeanie.</p>

<p>“By gracious!” cried Healy, slapping his
thigh, “if she hasn’t hit it!” We looked at
him inquiringly; he dropped his voice to a
stage whisper. “Come up here,” and he
started, dragging Mrs. Judge Pennoyer by
one hand up the new gravel slope beside the
line. Raoul followed, with Miss May; he
had been very silent that morning; and I
with Miss Jeanie. Her little foot was buried
at once in the sliding gravel, over the dainty
low shoe; I wanted to carry her up, had only
propriety sanctioned it. At the top, Healy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>swept the horizon as if for spies; then bending
over us, all in a close group, he said:</p>

<p>“Them ain’t real niggers&mdash;them’s United
States revenue officers from New Orleans,
under General McBride.”</p>

<p>“General McBride?”</p>

<p>“He’s in hidin’ in my hut. He wouldn’t
black up. But them deputy-marshals thought
it was a spree. We had to do it. Every
Saturday the niggers are paid off&mdash;one dollar
and fifty cents a day, nigh on to ten dollars
apiece&mdash;an’ then King Kelly he’d come down
from his stills in the mountain, with his men
loaded with casks o’ pine-top, warranted to
kill&mdash;an’ by sundown eighteen hundred niggers
would be blind-drunk, an’ fit for shootin’.
On last Sunday we lost sixty-two hands. An’
the head contractor, he swore nigh to lift yer
ha’r off.”</p>

<p>“Sixty-two men killed?” cried Jeanie, in
horror.</p>

<p>“Some killed, some wounded; but it tells
on the contract just the same. Why, you
could have heared ’em poppin’ all over camp.”</p>

<p>The Higginbothams had always been abolitionists;
and I felt my ancestors turn in
their complacent graves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>
<p>“Expect to get Kelly this time?” said Coe.</p>

<p>“Dunno, we’ll see at twelve o’clock, when
they’re paid off. It’ll be quite a thing to see,
all the same. But the ladies had better stay
in their tent. An’ it’s eleven now, so I
reckon we’ll go back to camp. See, there go
the marshals.”</p>

<p>When we got back to camp Raoul received
a telegram. He read it hastily, and crumpled
it into his pocket; but, I thought, looked
troubled.</p>

<p>Jeanie and I wandered down by the brook
side before dinner, and afterward Raoul,
Healy, Coe, and I sallied forth to “see the
fun.” We were let into the chief commissary’s
hut, the front of which, above a strong
wooden bar, was open; and before it a great
crowd of negroes, singing and dancing, and a
hundred others, in a long queue, waiting for
their pay. “You kin lie down on the floor
ef they git to shootin’,” said General
McBride, whom we found there smoking
placidly in a cane-seated chair. “Those revolvers
won’t carry through the boards.”</p>

<p>It was a curious spectacle, that line of coal-black,
stalwart, “swamp” negroes; and then
to watch the first human expression&mdash;in their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>case greed&mdash;impress their stolid features as
they took their pay. Among the crowd we
noticed many bearded, well-armed, flannel-shirted
mountaineers; these we took to be the
moonshiners; and near each one, but loitering
as if to avoid attention, one of the made-up
negroes; to us now obviously factitious.
It was a wonder the moonshiners did not find
them out, but that they were intent on other
things.</p>

<p>“See, that’s King Kelly,” whispered General
McBride. “That big fellow there with
the slouched hat and rifle.” Having said
this, I was surprised to hear him, when the
last man had been paid off, get up and make
a speech to the navvies, in which he congratulated
them that the camp had at last been
freed from that great pest, Kelly; and urged
them to save their money and be abstemious.
“I am General McBride, of New Orleans&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Gineral McBride, of
New Orleans!” cried a big mulatto opposite,
I thought at a sign from Healy. They were
given, not very heartily.</p>

<p>“And I’ve come up to see those poisoners
keep away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>I had seen the man he said was Kelly start
and look about him, as if for other enemies;
then he stood still nervously, and fidgetted at
his gun. Meanwhile the General made quite
a speech, apparently thinking the opportunity
too good a one to remain unimproved. He
took every occasion to heap obloquy upon the
head of Kelly, king of the moonshiners; and
concluded by lamenting that that “poor white
trash” would not dare to show his head in
camp while even he, McBride, was there
alone.</p>

<p>“Look yar,” shouted Kelly, striding up to
the bar of the tent when he had got through,
“I’m the man you call King Kelly; an’ I’ve
got four stills a-runnin’ within a bit an’ a
screech of this yer camp; an’ I kin tell yer
it’s deuced lucky yer white-faced, biled-shirted
revenue officers stayed down to New
Orleans.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said another, “I own a still myself;
an’ it ain’t goin’ ter stop up fur no
United States Government&mdash;though we’re
mighty glad to see the Gineral, ez he comes
here sociable and pleasant like.”</p>

<p>“And I,” “and I,” “and I;” and three
more strode forward, and I noticed a pair of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>pseudo darkies get behind each one as he
moved.</p>

<p>“What’ll yer take ter drink, Gineral?”
said Kelly. Quick as a flash, every man had
four stout arms about his neck, choking him,
and the handcuffs on his wrists. Not a shot
was fired; and Kelly and his gang were safely
immured in an improvised guardhouse. The
General sank back upon his cane-seated
chair.</p>

<p>“A pretty job, gentlemen,” said he.
“What <i>will</i> you take to drink? None of
their pine-top, though,” he added, with a
laugh. “Yet, I don’t know as you can hardly
blame ’em&mdash;corn’s mighty scarce up here.”</p>

<p>“May I trouble you, sir, with a few words
in private?” The voice was serious, but
familiar, and appertained to Mr. Hampton
Raoul.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>
<p class="ph2 nobreak">6.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“I</span> have</span> appealed to you, sir,” said Raoul,
when we had abandoned the still quiet
camp for the solitude of the forest, “to demand
that which every gentleman has the
right to ask of every other.”</p>

<p>I feared the man had some notion of a
duel, and his next words did not tend to
relieve me. “I have long loved Miss Bruce.”</p>

<p>I must have appeared disquieted, for he
hastened to add, “Miss May Bruce, I mean.
But until yesterday I did not know my love
was returned. We have now resolved on
being married.”</p>

<p>I expressed my congratulations, but intimated
that I did not yet see how my aid was
necessary.</p>

<p>“We have resolved to make our bridal
journey to the White Sulphur Springs, in
Virginia. We shall be married upon arrival
there, and I should esteem it a favor initial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>of a life-long friendship if you, sir, would consent
to be best man. Moreover, your escort
may prove necessary to Miss Jeanie to return.”</p>

<p>My escort! to Miss Jeanie! I was to travel
with her four hundred miles&mdash;meantime her
sister philandering with this young man&mdash;perhaps
make a visit at a fashionable watering-place&mdash;give
away her sister in matrimony&mdash;and
then make the principal bridesmaid
companion of my journey home! And this
young Huguenot, <i>pour sauver la situation</i>,
called me her escort. I looked at Raoul;
his attitude was impassive and his manner
still courteous; but evidently he thought
there was something unchivalric even in my
hesitation.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;has Miss Jeanie Bruce,” I hazarded,
“yet been told of your plans?”</p>

<p>“Of course&mdash;and she approves them. She
can hardly invite you herself to join her
party; it might look forward, as you and
she, necessarily, will be left much to yourselves.”</p>

<p>Absent-mindedly I twirled the ring on my
finger, still there, that she had given me.
Evidently, as a gentleman, in the eyes of him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>of her, and of her sister, there was nothing
else for me to do. “I must see Miss Bruce
herself,” I gasped.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Raoul. “I had reckoned,
sir, that such would be your course. I will
meet you in front of the commissary’s tent at
three. We start at four.” He stalked off,
and left me under the live-oak tree.</p>

<p>It was two o’clock. I felt that I must see
Miss Jeanie at once. Nothing could exceed
the good-breeding of her greeting; but she
evidently expected me to go. The calm of
her gentle voice told me so. I found the two
beautiful young girls in afternoon toilette of
white muslin, half reclining under their open
tent, fanning themselves. I think I would
not have been so much in doubt had not
Jeanie been so very pretty. Then, how hazard,
in the presence of her sister, and of her
own soft eyes, the fear that she might be
committing an impropriety?</p>

<p>And it was with the greatest difficulty
and an acute sense of my own brutality, that
I did so. I began by congratulating Miss
May, which evoked a lovable blush. “You
know we have to start after dark and drive
twenty miles to-night,” said she, “to a station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
on the Georgia road&mdash;we cannot return
the same way; Mr. Raoul has some reason.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that we four ought to go
off&mdash;ought to go off just like that?”</p>

<p>Miss Bruce looked at me, amazed. Jeanie
tried to help her. “Do you not have wedding-journeys
in the North?”</p>

<p>“Alone, I mean,” I ended, desperately.</p>

<p>“Alone? Mrs. Judge Pennoyer is going.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Judge Pennoyer had all the elements
of a true sport; and I went back to Raoul&mdash;(having
had a long walk down the brook with
Jeanie; her happiness in her sister’s prospects
was quite charming)&mdash;an hour after
the time fixed, less decided&mdash;I think there is
some adventurous blood in the Higginbothams&mdash;and
found the camp in a state of
wild tumult. Raoul met me nervously.</p>

<p>“General McBride paroled Kelly and his
gang,” said he, “and the moonshiners have
come back from the mountains a hundred
strong, and given the revenue officers twenty
minutes to leave for New Orleans.”</p>

<p>“And are they going?” said I.</p>

<p>“They calculate, sir, to go,” answered
Raoul, gravely. “The mule team will take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>them back to the head of the line, and there
we have wired for a special to carry them
back to Bagdad. I have decided it is best
for us to go with them. The special train
simplifies matters. I trust you have come to
a decision?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I do not know,” said I.</p>

<p>“We certainly cannot leave them here in
camp. Every nigger in it will be blind drunk
before midnight, and they are fortifying the
commissary’s store.”</p>

<p>“What on earth did McBride mean by
paroling those ruffians,” I sighed. “It was
beginning to be so pleasant.”</p>

<p>“It was an error of judgment. But it will
be equally pleasant at White Sulphur.”</p>

<p>As we talked we had returned to the centre
of the camp. There we found a picturesque
scene. McBride and his men were seated in
the glade of the live-oak forest, no longer disguised;
around them stood or lounged some
forty bearded mountaineers, all provided with
long rifles. General McBride was sitting
with King Kelly himself, amicably drinking
his own “pine-top;” as we approached he
rose to meet us and handed a telegram to
Raoul, who cast his eyes over it and gave it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>to me, with the remark that it might assist
my decision. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If cousins Miss Bruce are with you, detain
them and escorts. Will wire parental
authority to-morrow.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Kirk Bruce.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“I feel bound, sir, to ask you your intentions,”
said McBride to Raoul.</p>

<p>“Miss May Bruce and I are to be married,
sir.”</p>

<p>“In that case, sir,” said the General, “in
the absence of parental authority I cannot, of
course, interfere. Permit me to congratulate
you.” They shook hands.</p>

<p>“And this Northern gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Goes with me, of course. And Mrs.
Judge Pennoyer.”</p>

<p>“A most estimable lady. I knew her as a
girl.”</p>

<p>“We thought of returning on your special.”</p>

<p>“An excellent idea. Particularly as I have
an idea Mr. Bruce may pass us on Number
Two. But stop&mdash;we have unluckily only one
mule-team.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Is there no room?” I asked. For I, myself,
was beginning to see the necessity of
getting away&mdash;to White Sulphur or to Salem.</p>

<p>“Room enough&mdash;but you must remember
we have nigh twenty miles through the
woods. These gentlemen&mdash;” and the General
waved his hand at the surrounding moonshiners&mdash;“will
naturally take a few shots at
us.”</p>

<p>We looked at one another in perplexity.
The colloquy was interrupted by the appearance
of Jeanie and May, in travelling dress
again, but looking very charming, and Mrs.
Judge Pennoyer. To her the situation was
rapidly explained.</p>

<p>I have before remarked that Mrs. Pennoyer
was a true sport. She rose immediately
to the occasion, and desired to be introduced
to King Kelly.</p>

<p>“Colonel Kelly,” said she, “these young
ladies are travelling under my protection.
One of them is engaged to be married to Mr.
Raoul, and they are desirous of going to
White Sulphur on their wedding journey.
As there is only one wagon they must return
with General McBride’s party. I trust the
journey will be perfectly safe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Kelly scratched his head. “I can answer,
of course, for these gentlemen here,” said he,
“but some of my friends are out’n the mountain,
and it may be difficult to notify them of
the sitooation. Let me see your team,” he
added, as if a bright idea struck him.</p>

<p>The General and Kelly walked off in the
direction of the wagon. The ladies followed.
Raoul, Healy, Coe, and I followed the ladies.
The undisguised United States marshals followed
us, and the moonshiners followed the
marshals. It was a large wagon with high
wooden sides, bound with iron, and was used
for bringing supplies to camp. A team of
six of the biggest mules&mdash;some fully eighteen
hands high&mdash;was already being harnessed to
it.</p>

<p>“Reckon you can fix the ladies safely,”
said Kelly. “We are good shots on the
mountain,” he added, significantly, to McBride.</p>

<p>“I see your idea,” said the General.
“Bring some straw.”</p>

<p>The straw was brought and filled the bottom
of the wagon. Upon this sat the three
ladies. McBride, Coe, and Healy went on
the high front seat; Raoul and I sat on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>tail-board looking out behind; and the eight
revenue officers disposed themselves, four on
each side, sitting on the side-board with their
legs hanging over. They had nothing but
six-shooters, which, however, they displayed
with some ostentation.</p>

<p>“Colonel Kelly,” said Raoul, slipping
down after he had taken his seat, “lend me
one of your rifles&mdash;I want it very particularly”
(I heard him add the name of “Kirk
Bruce,” in the ear of that chief of moonshiners),
“and I’ll send it back in Number
Four to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“By G&mdash; you shall have it, sir.” And Kelly
gave him his own. “I like your spunk, sir;
an’ if you’n Mrs. Raoul will come back here
without them darned biled-shirted gov’en’m’nt
men, I’ll give you a real good time.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Colonel,” said Raoul. “Good-by&mdash;and
fire high.”</p>

<p>We departed amid quite a cheer; lumbering
out of the picturesque great camp some
two hours before sunset, and as we passed
the negroes’ quarters, heard already sounds
of revelry beginning. We felt the girls were
fairly safe between the double rampart of
men. Still, the General thought they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>perhaps better not sing (which they were
fond of doing), so the long ride was rather
silent. Raoul lay leaning back, talking in
whispers with May Bruce, and I was left to
do the same with Jeanie. Coming to the last
long hill before the end of the line, one or
two shots were fired; but they whistled in the
tree-tops far above our heads. We found the
“special” waiting for us, got into the one
“directors’ car,” and started safely.</p>

<p>But when we got to the siding at Bear
Creek, Raoul asked the conductor which
train had the right of way. Learning that
the special had, he beckoned to me, and, taking
his rifle, went out upon the rear platform.
I followed, wondering. Our train was running
rather fast, the engine having suddenly
started up after Raoul’s conversation with the
conductor; I presume to him also Raoul had
explained “the sitooation.” At Bear Creek
the regular up-train stood side-tracked waiting
for us. We rattled by, and on its rear
platform, in the moonlight, I saw a tall frock-coated
figure standing. I had hardly recognized
it to be Kirk Bruce when Raoul threw
up his rifle, and I saw a flash of fire from the
platform of the side-tracked Mr. Bruce. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>reports were quite simultaneous; but neither
was hurt, for I saw Bruce leaning his head
out of the shadow of the platform to look at
us, while Raoul remarked, as we went back
into the car, now jumping wildly on the down
grade:</p>

<p>“He knew I was yere, and I knew he was
thar. You’d hardly see worse rifle-practice
in the North.”</p>

<p>There was a tinge of disgust in his voice,
and he went out to smoke on the engine.</p>

<p>“Was it Cousin Kirk?” said May to me,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>I nodded. Jeanie blushed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>
<p class="ph2 nobreak">7.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> United States marshals from New
Orleans had kept rather quiet throughout
the journey; but as we approached the city of
Bagdad their spirits rose. The momentary
interest caused by Mr. Raoul’s and Cousin
Kirk’s shots had subsided when they learned
there was nothing national or professional
in the affair. Amateur shooting was always
poor. But May Bruce was considered with
more attention; and when their “special” of
a “shirt-tail” engine and a caboose backed up
to the Bagdad platform, they all requested to
be presented to her. General McBride performed
the ceremony with much formality;
including Mrs. Judge Pennoyer, upon whom,
I could see, they looked with a reverence that
only her years divided from admiration.
Even Raoul came in for some passive applause;
but I played, as I saw, a very second
fiddle, which is why, perhaps, Miss Jeanie
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>and I went off and took a walk, by moonlight,
down through the ravine where I first met
her.</p>

<p>We returned to find Mrs. Pennoyer slumbering
peacefully on a settee; but Raoul
was walking up and down nervously. The
straight track stretched glistening away in
the moonlight, but not a train nor engine was
in sight.</p>

<p>“How long do you think it’ll take Mr.
Bruce to get down back here?” says Raoul
to me, nervously.</p>

<p>“Train Number Two doesn’t come back
till to-morrow, they said.”</p>

<p>“I know; but the station man here tells
me the engineer on Number Two married a
cousin of Kirk Bruce’s brother-in-law. Our
train doesn’t come along from Memphis until
four in the morning. And there’s not an engine
to be had in Bagdad.”</p>

<p>“There’s one,” said I; and I pointed to a
distant shower of sparks above the forest.
At the same moment the peculiar light rattle
of a “wild” engine was audible.</p>

<p>“My God, sir, so it is!” answered Raoul.
“And it’s on the line of the Tennessee River
and Gulf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“Number Two?” I answered, grimly, for
I was getting to understand the ways of the
place. “What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Do?” said Raoul; “why, get ready, of
course. He may shoot before he stops the
engine; lucky I’ve got a rifle. You go in and
prepare the ladies.... This is my
quar’l,” he added, impatiently, at my demur.
“Besides you ain’t got only that girl’s pop-gun.
Reckon you’ll have a chance later,
likely.”</p>

<p>So I went in, and told the girls; and we
woke up Mrs. Judge Pennoyer, who, I am
bound to say, took it more calmly than might
have been expected from a lady of her years.
May was tearful; but Jeanie’s eyes were very
bright. All this time the rattle of the engine
was growing louder down the grade.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you kept that revolver I gave
you?” said Jeanie to me.</p>

<p>I looked at her; and went out upon the
platform just in time to see the engine dash
up, and a strange figure jump out of the cab.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he cried; “drop your
iron. I’ve got a message from King Kelly.”
I observed the man had a blackened face and
uncouth costume; he did not look like an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>engineer, though a negro fireman was on the
smoking engine. The saturnine Raoul tore
open the envelope, read the letter twice, and
handed it to me with the nearest approach to
a chuckle I had heard him give. I also
read it, while the negro fireman opened half
his head and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“What will you take, sir?” I heard Raoul
say; then, as the ladies, overcome by
the curiosity this unexpected-silence caused,
came out upon the platform, I heard him introducing
the man of the charcoal face to
each in turn.</p>

<p>The letter was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">&mdash;&mdash; Raoul, Esq.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: A gentleman have arrived
here on Number Two, inkwiring for you, and
I take him for to be a member of Mrs. Raoul’s
family, so I got him and his ingineer here in
Camp and reckon I kin hold him about till
termorrer sundown.</p>

<p class="right4">“Yours trooly,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lucius R. Kelly</span>.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>
<p class="ph2 nobreak">8.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">B</span>eati Possidentes</span>. I now saw that
under the methods of Southern courtship
the man who had got the lady had a great
advantage. The Memphis express pulled up
at four in the morning in front of a burning
tar-barrel on the track, which Raoul had
placed there as a hint to it to stop at Bagdad.
How our story always got out so quickly,
I don’t know; but two members of Congress
from Mississippi turned out of the two
end sections and were accommodated with
shakedowns in the smoking compartment of
the crowded Pullman, with Raoul and myself.</p>

<p>I did not sleep very well, and at seven in
the morning got out at Chattanooga. What
was my surprise at seeing Mrs. Judge Pennoyer
also emerge, fully dressed, from the
sleeping-car.</p>

<p>“You young people don’t want me,” said
she, benevolently. “I should only be in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>way. An’ I’m getting out here to take the
day train on to Knoxville. If I got out thar,
they might stop ye before the train pulled
out again; now ye’ll all get by unbeknownst.”</p>

<p>What could I oppose to such strategy?
Moreover, the young ladies were still in their
berths. I could not leave Miss Jeanie to
come back alone. I bowed; the train started;
I got in it.</p>

<p>The sunlight broadened, but it was high
noon and we had passed Knoxville before
the two girls appeared, fresher than the June
morning, and rosier, I am sure, than Raoul
or I. With some trepidation I told them of
Mrs. Pennoyer’s evasion.</p>

<p>“Dear Aunt Emily,” said May, “she has
always been like a mother to me.” But
Jeanie, I fancied, blushed; and that day
talked to Raoul, while May was left to me.</p>

<p>The impending catastrophe made May
very gentle and silent, but we now heard
Jeanie and Mr. Raoul in speech of much
light laughter at the other end of the car.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said I, “they are laughing at
the way Mr. Kirk Bruce’s pursuit has stopped
in moonshine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Miss. May looked at me inquiringly.
“Cousin Kirk was never attentive to me,”
said she.</p>

<p>“He is attentive enough now,” I laughed;
and she looked at me as if about to say something&mdash;but
bit her red lips.</p>

<p>Jeanie certainly avoided me. When Raoul
came back to talk to his fiancée, her sister
made pretext of a headache and lay down.
The train was not a quick one, and stopped
long periods at several stations, during which
Raoul was obviously nervous. His brow
only cleared when we got to Bristol, Va.,
about sunset. Here we stopped an hour for
supper, half of which we four devoted to a
walk. The town consisted principally of a
long straight street, lined by low two-story
brick shops; the one-story shops had false
fronts and presented an appearance of uniformity.
Boots, saddles, guns, groceries, and
drygoods were the articles they sold.</p>

<p>I had noticed that Raoul kept persistently
on one side of the street, and when I started
to cross over, to look at a particularly gorgeous
embroidered Mexican saddle on the other
side, he held me back.</p>

<p>“This street,” said he, “is the State line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>between Virginia and Tennessee. I think we
had better keep on the Virginia side.”</p>

<p>“How odd,” said Jeanie, “to have a town
divided against itself!”</p>

<p>“It is a great convenience,” answered Mr.
Raoul. “When my father and Colonel Carington
had their dispute about the last constitutional
convention, both were candidates
for the governorship, my father in Tennessee
and the colonel in Virginia. The constitution
of Tennessee disqualified a man who
fought a duel from holding office. So my
father stood on the Virginia side of the street
and the colonel in Tennessee. The distance
between the sidewalks is just about right, as
you see. There was a warrant out against
my father in Tennessee and the colonel in
Virginia.”</p>

<p>“And did they fight?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;and the sheriffs looked on, but
they couldn’t cross the street. And the colonel,
he allowed he was shot accidentally by a
bullet from another State. The case went up
to the Supreme Court, but they allowed they
couldn’t say any duel was fought in Tennessee,
and the Constitution does not disqualify
a man for shooting, but only just for duelling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>At this point a prolonged whistling recalled
us to the station. Here we found an
elegant Pullman car added to the train for
our accommodation, “with the superintendent’s
compliments to Mr. Raoul.” The
darky porters in it were smiling broadly, and
on the table was a huge bouquet of orange-blossoms.</p>

<p>In the morning we woke up&mdash;or Raoul
woke me up&mdash;at the station for White Sulphur.
He had a telegram signed “Emily
Pennoyer,” which warned him to lose no
time, that Kirk Bruce was on the night express.</p>

<p>“May and I have decided to go to the
county Judge and get married directly,” said
he. Our Pullman car had been shunted on a
side track at the little station; the rest of
the train had gone on, and the little village
was quiet and fragrant as a bank of wild
flowers. “Fortunately, he is a friend of my
father’s.”</p>

<p>We found the Judge, I think, before his
breakfast, smoking on his piazza, which was
covered with jasmine and magnolia. He led
us directly across the road to a little brick
court-house, where he found another couple
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>waiting already, more sheepish than ourselves,
who had driven all night in a buggy, with an
old white horse. The groom was awkward
and embarrassed, with his trousers tucked in
his boots; the bride was buxom and blushing,
but seemed hardly more than a child.</p>

<p>“First come, first served,” said the Judge,
and we all went into the court-house, where
the clerk unlocked his register, and the
blushing pair stood up before us, the groom
having first hitched the old white horse to
the fence outside. We four were accommodated
with seats upon the bench.</p>

<p>“Do you think she’s twenty-one?” whispered
the Judge to Raoul, while the rustic
bride shuffled uneasily upon her new shoes.</p>

<p>“Twenty-one? She’s not eighteen,” said
Raoul.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” whispered the Judge. “Guess
she’ll have to be&mdash;reckon I’ll forget to ask
her.”</p>

<p>The pair were married with us as witnesses;
Jeanie gave the bride her parasol for
a wedding present, and the old white horse
and buggy scrambled away. “And now,”
said the Judge, turning to Jeanie, “how old
are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>There was a pause of embarrassment; then
Raoul spoke up bravely: “It’s not Miss
Jeanie&mdash;it’s Miss May Bruce, and she’s quite
eighteen.”</p>

<p>“Eighteen?” said the Judge. “She must
be twenty-one&mdash;or have you the parents’ consent?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Raoul. “Eighteen is old
enough in Alabama.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one in Virginia,” said the Judge.
“Give me the Code.”</p>

<p>The clerk handed him a musty leather
volume from beneath a musty leather Bible.
Twenty-one it was, sure enough.</p>

<p>“Why did you say she was only eighteen?”
said the Judge, peevishly.</p>

<p>“But you married the others,” answered
I.</p>

<p>“True,” said the Judge, “but I’ve had a
telegram for you&mdash;from a Mr. Kirk Bruce,
who, I take it, is a relative of the bride.”</p>

<p>Raoul’s face maintained its customary look
of quiet determination. “Where is the nearest
State where a lady is free to get married
at eighteen?”</p>

<p>“South Carolina,” said the Judge.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Raoul. “I’ve got a car,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>and I reckon Colonel Carington will give us
transportation.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see that he does,” said the Judge, his
face brightening.  “I guess you’d better go
to Charleston.”</p>

<p>“Spartanburg is the nearest point,” said
Raoul. “He’ll never think of Spartanburg.”</p>

<p>“True,” said the Judge, “he’ll never think
of Spartanburg. Lucky, Colonel Carington
is at the Springs.”</p>

<p>In two hours we had borrowed an old
freight engine and were off on our way to
Spartanburg.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>
<p class="ph2 nobreak">9.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> freight engine had been loaned us by
telegram from Colonel Carington, and we
had found our Pullman car pulled up on an
old rusty side-track that ran into a bed of wild
flowers; on the front platform, half smothered
by them, our two darkies were asleep.
They wakened, however, to greet us with
smiles of such expansive intimacy that I felt
bound, when we were safely on the way, to
put them <i>au courant</i> of the situation. The
solemnity and sympathy their faces at once
assumed guaranteed their discretion; though
I afterward heard the “conductor” adjuring
the engineer from the front platform to “git
up that thar burro-engine wif’m bacon-ham.”
Whereupon the engineer sanded the track and
blew “off brakes.”</p>

<p>The long journey was rather distressing,
however. The brave girls did not lose their
spirits, but they kept to themselves, resting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>in the state-room, while Raoul and I sat on
the rear platform and watched the dust eddy
up from the long single track behind us.
We had innumerable waits and sidings;
where often the girls and I wandered into
the woods after wild flowers, while Raoul
stayed behind to pepper Mrs. Judge Pennoyer
with telegrams. We were now by the
highest mountains of the East; Roan Mountain
still, though it was June, was rosy-robed
about its shoulders with the laurel.</p>

<p>The day wore on, and I could get no
speech with Jeanie. I looked for my <i>dédommagement</i>
to the journey home. This I no
longer dreaded; it was a rosy hope. But
Jeanie was so timid, now&mdash;or I was bolder.
In the evening we had a long wait for the
night express, which rattled by our siding at
a wood-and-water station.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mr. Bruce is on that train,” I
laughed.</p>

<p>“No,” said Raoul, gravely (he never had a
sense of humor); “I am confident he is
not.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I have had a telegram from Mrs. Judge
Pennoyer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“Is she his confidante?”</p>

<p>“She says that he has suddenly decided
to await your return in Knoxville.”</p>

<p>“Await my return?”</p>

<p>“Certainly&mdash;yours and Miss Jeanie’s. I
conclude the Judge this morning wired him
an answer that it was not Jeanie who was
getting married.”</p>

<p>I gasped. “Then it was not you, after all,
he was chasing?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course not.”</p>

<p>“Why did you run away so?”</p>

<p>Raoul looked at me as who should say,
“Oh, these Northerners!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it wasn’t necessary,” he added,
with that faint tinge of sarcasm which is
akin to humor. “Is that your ring you wear
upon your finger?”</p>

<p>I know I started; and I felt myself blush.
“It&mdash;it was given to me to wear,” I gasped.</p>

<p>“Exactly&mdash;and by Miss Jeanie Bruce&mdash;and
Mr. Kirk Bruce gave it to Miss Jeanie.
Of course he thought&mdash;when he heard a
Miss Bruce and a gentleman had gone off to
get married&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Kirk Bruce gave it to her?” I said. My
mind works slowly at such times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hey</span> were married the next day in the
pretty little Episcopal church in Spartanburg,
by the Bishop of Georgia. They left
the same afternoon on their wedding journey
back to “Old White” and the North. Miss
Jeanie Bruce and I accompanied them&mdash;or
rather, they us&mdash;as far as the junction station
(I forget its name), where they met the east-bound
train, and we were to keep on to
Knoxville.</p>

<p>Jeanie’s sweet face was very pale, but her
eyes were like deep wells&mdash;so deep now that
they indeed “unravelled the coiled night and
saw the stars by noon.” She had to sit by
me now; but her silence appealed even to a
blunted Northern sense of chivalry. I foresaw
that I, too, should have to keep silence
until I had brought her home to Knoxville.
But not a day longer! Not an hour, I finally
vowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>But oh, the beauty of that immediate
future! The long twenty hours’ journey
after they left us at the junction&mdash;where she
was under my protection, and no Kirk Bruce
could say me nay! Even chivalry at such
times is like a <i>sordine</i> on one harp-string&mdash;heart-string
I had almost said. And one’s
being is so resonant that the note of speech
is hardly missed.</p>

<p>So, I had my two-hours’ day-dream, and
then Mrs. Judge Pennoyer turned up on that
east-bound train, as chaperone to bring us
home.</p>

<p>“You telegraphed for her?” I said to
Jeanie.</p>

<p>She did not deny it; and I thought Mrs.
Pennoyer cast one look at me as of contempt.</p>

<p>Then I saw her see the ring upon my
finger, and her expression seemed to change.</p>

<p>We saw the happy pair go off, and we
went back to our seats in the returning train.
We three; and one of us most miserable, and
that was I.</p>

<p>I had given up all hope of talking with
Jeanie any more. She went off with Mrs.
Pennoyer to a front seat, where I saw them
in earnest consultation; and that ancient relict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
of justice tempered by mercy appeared
to be speaking of me. I watched them; and
I heard the words “Mr. Bruce” and “the
ring;” and I saw Jeanie grow still more pale.</p>

<p>Finally, to my glad astonishment, she rose,
and like a brave lady&mdash;not like those Northern
girls I knew in Salem, who would not
dare throw a man a life preserver to save
him from drowning&mdash;sweet and gracious, she
came back to me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Higginbotham” (what a name to set
by Raoul, or even Bruce), “I must have my
ring again,” said she.</p>

<p>“Never,” I answered. “It is not your
ring, but mine.”</p>

<p>“I only lent it to you. I did not give it.”</p>

<p>“Then lend it to me a little longer&mdash;till I
have seen you home,” I said.</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears, and my heart
was drowned in them.</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Pennoyer says Cousin Kirk is
waiting for us there. Oh, please.”</p>

<p>“Let him wait,” I said.</p>

<p>“But, please. I implore you&mdash;as
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As I love you,” I said. “As I love you,
I shall keep it. Will you marry me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“I&mdash;I do not love you,” she answered, almost
in a whisper. “Now, will you give it
back?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said.</p>

<p>I saw her tears. “He will kill you;” and
she left me, sobbing.</p>

<p>“Then, you can take it,” I called out, after
her.</p>

<p>Man can be brutal at such times.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pennoyer came back and tried to
move me. Who could, after Jeanie Bruce
had failed? Moreover, I thought she
thought she would have done like me.</p>

<p>I fear Jeanie cried most of that journey
home. But I, as is the way of man, was
happy.</p>

<p>We got back to Knoxville in the early
morning. They did not wish me to go home
with them from the station; so I put them in
a carriage, and sat upon the box. We drove
up to the piazza of the little house upon
which sat a man in a black frock-coat, smoking
a cigar. He threw it away, and took off
his hat to the ladies. We both assisted them
out; and Jeanie ran quickly into the house,
Mrs. Judge Pennoyer following. I paid the
carriage, and it drove away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said Mr. Kirk Bruce.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said I.</p>

<p>“I will request you, sir, for to give me
that ring that is on your finger.”</p>

<p>“That ring does not belong to me.”</p>

<p>“That is why, sir, I ask you as a gentleman,
fo’ to give it up.”</p>

<p>“That is why, sir, I am compelled as a
gentleman, fo’ to refuse.”</p>

<p>Insults to one’s diction come next to those
that touch the heart. Mr. Bruce had me,
forthwith, “covered” with his revolver.</p>

<p>“Are you engaged to Miss Jeanie Bruce?”</p>

<p>“I am not.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, as a gentleman, you have no
right to wear that ring.”</p>

<p>I had heard vague stories of firing through
one’s coat pocket; and I felt in mine for the
little revolver Jeanie had given me. But the
miserable little toy was turned the wrong
way, and I could not twist it about.</p>

<p>“He is engaged to me&mdash;he is,” cried
Jeanie, bursting out from the front door.
“He asked me on the train.”</p>

<p>“And you refused me,” I said, turning my
eyes for one moment away from Bruce to
look at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“I did not&mdash;I only&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>How it happened, I do not know; but at
that instant the confounded revolver went off
in my pocket. With a cry, Jeanie threw up
her arms and fell upon the floor of the piazza.
Bruce and I were at her feet instantly. Mrs.
Pennoyer rushed out. The neighbors rushed
across from over the way.</p>

<p>“Is she killed?” said Bruce and I, together.</p>

<p>As we spoke Jeanie made a dart, and picking
up Bruce’s revolver, which he had
dropped upon the grass, threw it over a high
board fence into the neighboring lot. Then
turning, “Give me your ring,” said she.</p>

<p>I gave it to her.</p>

<p>“And now,” she said, replacing it on another
finger, “Cousin Kirk, let me introduce
to you the gentleman to whom I am to be
married&mdash;Mr. Higginbotham, of Boston.”</p>

<p>“Salem,” I corrected, in a dazed way.</p>

<p>“Of Salem. Cousin Kirk&mdash;congratulate
him.”</p>

<p>Cousin Kirk looked at her, at me, and at
the board fence.</p>

<p>“As a gentleman, sir, I have no other
thing to do. Of course&mdash;if my cousin loves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>you&mdash;you may keep the ring. Though I
must allow, sir, you shoot rather late.”</p>

<p>With this one simple sarcasm he departed.
Jeanie and I watched him groping in the long
grass of the next lot for his revolver and then
go slouching down the road. We turned and
our eyes met. I tried to take her hand; but
suddenly her face grew scarlet. “Oh, what
have I done?” and she rushed into the
house.</p>

<p>I went back to Salem.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I stayed there just four days. In New
York I met Jerry Sullivan and had a talk
with him. He will, in future, suppress his
sense of humor when inditing telegrams.</p>

<p>Then I wrote and asked Jeanie if she
would accept me, save at the pistol’s mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Raoul accompanied us on
our wedding journey; and we were married
at White Sulphur by the genial justice <i>de
céans</i>.</p>

SEBASTIAN MARQUES DEL TORRE<br />
AND OF DOLORES, HIS WIFE,<br />
CONDESA DE LUNA</span></h2></div>

<p class="ph2 nobreak" id="I">I.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>aganism</span> was the avowal of life;
Christianity the sacrifice of it. So the
world civilized has always separated at the
two diverging roads, according as brain or
blood has ruled their lives; the Turanian
races, and after them the Latins, to assert
life; the Semitic races, and after them the
Teutons, to deny it. So the Church of Rome,
as nearest in time to Paganism, has been
nearer the avowal of life, has recognized,
through all its inquisitions, human hearts;
the Sects have sought to stifle them; the
Puritans have posed to ignore them. Thus
cruelty may be the crime of priests; hypocrisy
has been the vice of preachers.</p>

<p>Hence my poor friend Tetherby, spinning
his affections from his brain, tired with a
mesh of head-wrought duties, died, or rather
ceased to live, of a moral heart-failure. His
heart was too good to be made out of brains
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>alone; and his life was ended with the loss
of that girl of his&mdash;what was her name,
Myra, Marcia?&mdash;born, in the Northland, of a
warmer blood, who fell a victim there, as the
rose-tree does in too cold a climate, to the
creeping things of earth. Now it happened
that that same year I was told the story of
Dolores, Marquesa del Torre y Luna, almost
the last of the old Spanish nobility of Carácas,
called la doña sola de la casa del Rey&mdash;as
we should say, the lonely lady of the house
of the King&mdash;for she lived there, married and
widow, fifty years, and left no child to inherit
the thick-walled city house, four square
about its garden, and the provinces of coffee-trees,
and, what she prized more and we prize
less, the noble blood of Torre and of Luna,
now run dry.</p>

<p>There are two things in the little city of
Carácas that go back to the time when the
Spanish empire made a simulacrum of the
Roman round the world&mdash;one is the great
round-arched Spanish bridge, spanning the
deep arroyo on the mountain slope above
the present town&mdash;useless now, for the earthquake
clefts are deeper on either side than
this gorge of the ancient river of the city,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>and have drained its stream away&mdash;and the
other this great stone fortress in the centre
of the present town, with walls eight feet
thick, its windows like tunnels cut through
to the iron unglazed casement&mdash;for this was
the only house that was left standing on the
evening of the great earthquake; and so the
modern city clusters timidly about it, its
houses a modest one- or double-story, and,
on the clay slope where the older city was,
the cactus grows, and the zenith sun burns
the clay banks red, and the old “gold-dust
road,” over the Cordillera to the sea, now
but a mule-path of scattered cobble-stone,
winds lonely and narrow across the splendid
bridge, among the great fissures that the
earthquake left. And both bridge and house
still bear the sculptured blazonry, the lions
and the castles, and the pious inscription to
the greater glory of the Virgin.</p>

<p>Carácas lies in a plain, like the Vega of
Granada, only green with palms as well as
poplars; but through its rich meadows a turbid
mountain torrent runs, and south, and
west, and east are mountains; and north the
mighty Silla lifts almost to the snows, half
breaking the ceaseless east wind of the sea;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>trade-wind, it has been called in history;
slave-wind were better. And by the little city
is the palm-clad Calvareo, the little hill gay
with orchids and shaded by tree-ferns, in
whose pleasant paths the city people still
take their pleasure (for the name of Calvary
but means the view, not any sadness), and
took their pleasure, eighty years since, when
this story begins. And one evening, in the
early years of the century, there walked
alone, or with but a nurse for her dueña, a
girl whose beauty still smiles down through
sad tradition and through evil story, to
lighten the dark streets of the old Spanish
town, whose stones for many years her feet
have ceased to press. And the memory of
the old Casa Rey, the castle, all is hers; and
the people of the town, the Caraqueños, still
see her lovely face at the window; first at
one, and then at the other, but mostly at
the grated window in the round tower of the
corner, that projects and commands the two
streets; for there her sweet, pale face used
to show itself, between the bars, and watch
for the cavalry her noble husband led, returning
from the wars. For then were wars of
liberation, when freedom was fought for, not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>possession and estates; and the Marquis
Sebastian Ruy del Torre led in all. And
days and days she would watch for him returning,
after battles won, she sitting with her
golden needle-work at the corner window,
her night-black hair against the iron bar (for
there are no glass window-panes in Carácas),
her strange blue eyes still watching down the
street. So she sat there, and broidered chasuble
or altar-cloth for the holy church of Santa
Maria de las Mercedes, where she prayed each
dawn and evening, yet cast her eyes down
either street between each stitch, to watch
the coming of him she loved on earth. And
the people of Carácas used to gather her
glances to their hearts, like blue flowers, for
of herself they saw no more than this.</p>

<p>But her husband, from their wedding-day,
never saw her more. For fifty years she sat
at this window, working chasuble and stole,
and always, when the distant trumpet
sounded, or the first gold-and-scarlet pennon
fluttered far down the street, she would drop
her work and rise. And then she would
wave her hand, and her husband would
wave his hand, at the head of his column far
away. This was for the populace. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>then she would go from the window; and
be seen there no more while he stayed at
Carácas.... But those that were beneath
the window used to say (for the husband
was too far off then to see) that before
she left the window, she would cast a long
look down the street to that distance where
he rode, and those that saw this glance say
that for sweetness no eye of mortal saw its
equal, and the story is, it made little children
smile, and turned old bad men good, and
even women loved her face.</p>

<p>Then she vanished from the tower, and
they saw her no more. During all the time
that might be the Marquis’s stay, no more
she came to the window, no more to the
door. State dinners were given there in the
King’s house; banquets, aye, and balls, where
all that was Castilian in Carácas came; but
the custom was well known, and no one marvelled
that the châtelaine came not to meet
them; the lovely Lady Dolores, whom no
one ever spoke to or saw. Some dueña, some
relation, some young niece or noble lady,
cousin of either the del Torre, was there and
did the honors. And of the Marquesa no
one ever spoke, for it was understood that,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>though not in a convent, she was no longer
in the world&mdash;even to her husband, it was
said, at first with bated breath, then openly.</p>

<p>For the servants told, and the family, and
it was no secret, how days and weeks before
her lord returned the lady would busy herself
with preparations. And their state suite of
rooms, and their nuptial-chamber (into which,
alas! she else had never come!) were prepared
by her, and made bright and joyous with rich
flowers, and sweet to his heart by the knowledge
of her presence, and the touch of her
dear hand. Then, when all was done, and
one white rose from her bosom in a single
vase (and in a score of years this white rose
never failed), she darkened the rooms and
left them for his coming, and went back to
her seat in the stone-floored tower room,
and sat there with her gold and silver embroidery,
and so watched for him. And
while he stayed in his palace, she lived in
those cold, bare rooms; for they alone had
not been changed when they were married,
but had been kept as they had been a
prison, and my lady Dolores loved them
best; but she came not now to the window,
lest their eyes might meet.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o</span> fifty years she lived there; and that is
why the old Spaniard of Carácas still
points out the house, and young men and
maidens like to make their trysting-places of
its gardens, which are public and where the
band plays evenings&mdash;if that can be called
trysting to our northern notions, which is but
a stolen mutual glance in passing. But hearts
are warm in Catholic Spain, and they dare not
more; right hard they throb and burn for
just so much as this&mdash;aye, and break for the
lack of it. I say, fifty years&mdash;fifty years she
lived there, but forty she lived alone, for at
the end of ten years he died; and the manner
of her living and his dying is what I
have to tell.</p>

<p>But after that still forty years she lived
on alone. Now she no longer worked at the
window, and she came there but rarely. It
seemed she came there for compassion, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>the people, whom she felt so loving, might
see her smile. For her smile was sweet as
ever, only now it bore the peace of heaven,
not the yearning love of earth. Yet never
went she out her doors. And when she died&mdash;it
is only some years since&mdash;they buried
her upon Good Friday, and she sleeps in her
own church, beneath the great gold shrine
she loved and wrought for, of Mary, Mother
of the Pities. And all the people of the city
saw her funeral; and there is, in the church,
a picture of the Virgin, that is really her,
painted by a dying artist that had seen her
face at the window many years before.</p>

<p>And did they not, the Caraqueños, wonder
and ask the cause of this?&mdash;What was it?&mdash;They
do not know&mdash;But did they not ask
the story of the lonely lady, so well known to
them?&mdash;They asked many years since; but
soon gave over; partly that the secret was
impenetrable, partly for love of her. For
they had, the poorest peasant of them, that
quick sympathy to stanch heart’s wounds
that all the conventions of the strenuous
North must lack. God gives in all things
compensation; and even sins, that are not
mean or selfish, have their half atoning virtues.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
Their silence was soothing to her sorrow;
they never knew. But the priest?&mdash;The
Church of Rome is cruel, but it keeps its
secrets. And only it and Heaven know if
their lives were one long agony of misguidance,
as many lives must be on earth&mdash;perhaps
sometimes the priest-confessor may help
in such affairs; if so, God speed the Jesuits.
But one thing is sure: in all their lives, after
their marriage, they never met. She died
old, in gentle silence; he still young, upon a
bloody field; and now their eyes at last met
in Heaven, “her soul he knows not from her
body, nor his love from God.”</p>

<p>And we may, harmless, venture to tell
what the people of Carácas say&mdash;with reverent
memory, and loving glances at the old
stone house; the hearts that inhabited it are
cold; but its Spanish arms above the door
still last, clear-cut as on the day the pride of
this world’s life first bade the owner place
them there.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the Calvareo that evening the Doña Dolores
walked alone, with only old Jacinta,
the black nurse; black she was called, but
her hair alone was black&mdash;blue-black; her
face was of that fiery brown that marks the
Venezuelan Indian; she was not fat, as most
nurses, but stood erect, with fierce lurid eyes,
her hair in two tight braids, and was following
and watching her gentle charge. Jacinta
had things to do in our story; her race has
nothing of the merry sloth, the gross animality
of the negro; what things Jacinta found
to do, were done. She was scarce a dozen
years older than her mistress, and her form
was still as lithe, her step as firm and quick
as that of that boy of hers, now twelve, in the
military school, training under the <i>soutane’d</i>
Jesuits for the service of the Church&mdash;or
Bolivar. And in the Calvareo also that evening
were two men&mdash;nephew and uncle, both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>cousins of Dolores&mdash;and not, of course, walking
with her or speaking to her, save by reverent
bows; and, on the nephew’s part at
least, by looks of fire. Yet the uncle might,
perhaps, have walked with her, even in Carácas;
for he, whom men called the General,
despite his prouder titles, was not her cousin
only, but her guardian.</p>

<p>Dolores and her maid have traversed the
spiral path to the summit of the little hill;
there is a little pool and fountain that the
Moors, generations back, had taught these
people’s ancestors to build; and from a
bench among the orchids and the jasmine,
and the charming amaryllis lily, standing
sentry by her, like a band of spearmen, sees
Dolores the lovely valley, purple in the first
shadows of the short tropic day, and, on the
southern mountain, the white walls of the
Archbishop’s new convent; to the north, and
higher, the little mountain fort guarding the
road to the coast, and, as she looks, it dips
its colors to the sunset, which are the yellow
and red&mdash;the blood and gold&mdash;of Spain, and
the booming of its little cannon echoes down
the valley and the Angelus replies. Then
she turns, and touches tenderly (not plucks)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>a marvellous lonely flower that blooms beside
her. It is the Eucharis Amazonica, the lily
of the Amazon, but known to her only as the
<i>Flor del Espiritu santo</i>&mdash;the flower of the
Holy Ghost. One moment, it seems that she
will be disturbed. The younger man has
left the older on his walk&mdash;for they are not
always together, and gossip has made him
suitor for his cousin’s hand, and he stands a
moment watching her, behind a group of tree-ferns.
No lovelier a girl had surely even his
eyes ever rested on, as she sat there stilly,
though her wonderful eyes were lost to him,
following the sunset. And she was the greatest
heiress in all the Spanish Main.</p>

<p>He might have stepped forward, into the
open, to her, and no one but Jacinta would
have known. Perhaps he was about to do
so; but suddenly there appeared, on the hilltop
beside them, a tall figure dressed in a
purple gown, with hood and trimmings of
bright scarlet, looking like a fuchsia flower;
on his head was a little black velvet covering
shaped half like a crown. It was the young
Jesuit, the Archbishop of the Guianas. Dolores
rose and kissed his hand, bending the
knee respectfully; he sat down beside her.</p>

of dead parents who represented
both branches of a famous old Gothic family,
already known about the capital for her
beauty, was known far and wide as the richest
heiress in all Venezuela and Guiana;
her prairies stretched from the ocean to
the Apure, her herds so countless that they
roamed wild upon pampas which were hers,
hunted by peons who were hers. The old
stone castle with the Spanish arms was
hers, and another like it stood empty for
her in far Madrid. Her guardian, the Marquis
del Torre, was a poor man beside her;
and his nephew, Don Ramon, poorer still.</p>

<p>Dolores was brought up as follows: At
five she rose, and went, with Jacinta, to early
mass&mdash;nearly always to a different church, as
is the seemly custom in Carácas, lest young
men should take advantage of it and take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>position behind the chairs of their adored
ones in church, where they could not be repelled;
for, of course, no young gentleman,
however madly in love, would insult his lady
by accosting her in the open street. After
mass, at six, being the time of sunrise and
by comparison safe, Jacinta would take her
charge for a walk, usually on the Calvareo,
then deserted. At seven they would be home,
and then in the great court-yard, under the
palms and rose-red orchids, Dolores would
take her lessons&mdash;French, English, music&mdash;all
from priests. At eleven, bath; at twelve,
breakfast; then reading, perhaps a siesta in
a hammock made of birds’ plumage. So she
passed her days, all in the half-light of the
great court-yard; only toward sunset again
would she see the open sky, driving with one
of her two governesses in the state carriage
down the broad valley to where the wheel
road stopped, and back again; or more rarely,
as on this night, venturing on another
walk. And all the youth of Carácas would
gaze after her carriage; the young men driving
out too, by themselves, in carriages, who
had passed their days more in gambling or
cock-fighting than with books and music;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>never, indeed, at mass. For here the lords of
creation vent their authority in ordaining
their wives and sisters to the Church and
goodness, themselves to evil. But the most
hardened duellist among them could no
more than look at Dolores; only her reckless
cousin Ramon would venture to ride athwart
her carriage, and presume upon his cousinship
to bow.</p>

<p>Yet intercourse is possible always betwixt
young people who seek each other out; and
all Carácas gave Ramon to her for her suitor.
And to-night even, as he stood and glowered
at the Archbishop from behind the tree-ferns,
he had another chance. For there is, and
was, one more strange custom in this strange
city; at the sunset hour the young ladies of
Carácas, all in their gayest dresses, sit in the
great open windows and look upon the street&mdash;a
curious sight it is to see the bright eyes
and white throats thrust, like birds from a
cage, through the iron bars of the sombre
stone windows. (For no wind or cold ever
needs a window of glass in that perpetual
perfect weather; the high sun never makes
a shutter needful in the narrow streets.)
And there they sit, unoccupied; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>young men of the city, dressed also in their
best, walk by as slowly, and look as lingeringly,
as they dare; and perhaps, if the dark
shadow of mamma or the dueña does not
come out too quickly from the inner room,
a few quick words are spoken, and a flower
left or given. And what says the old proverb
of the Caraqueños?</p>

<p>“<i>Better two words in secret than a thousand
openly.</i>”</p>

<p>Sebastian Ruy, Marques del Torre, too,
was bred as a young nobleman of oldest lineage
should be, or should have been, in that
early eighteenth century that still lingered
then in the Andes. But this took him to Madrid
and to Paris in the years VII. and VIII.;
and the eighteenth century, as one knows,
ended in those wee small numbers. Torre
came back to plunge his country in a revolution
which lasted intermittently, like one of
its own volcanoes, for more than twenty years.
The young Parisian étudiant began his first
émeute in Carácas itself, with a barricade
after the orthodox fashion of the years I. and
II. This being quickly suppressed&mdash;partly
that there were no pavements, and partly that
each house was an impregnable fortress&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>mostly that the city was of the governing class
and stood with Spain&mdash;Torre had had to leave
the capital for the pampas, where, for over
twelve years, he maintained discursive warfare
with a changeable command of Indians
and peons, which, however, on the whole, increased
in numbers, officered by a few young
gentlemen, under himself. His marquisate
he forgot, and sought to make others forget it.
He was, throughout Venezuela, The General.
He had never been back within the walls of
Carácas; and, at nearly forty, he learned of
his only aunt’s death following his uncle’s,
and of the little girl they left, and of his
guardianship.</p>

<p>A little girl she appeared to his imagination
on the pampas; when he got to Carácas,
she was a young woman. The General’s locks
were already grizzled and his face weather-beaten
with ten years’ open life on the plains;
his face was marked, close beside the eye,
with the scar of a sabre. He had one interview
with Dolores, saw her nurse, her instructors,
her father confessor; heard stories
about his nephew Don Ramon, which
troubled him, went back to camp.</p>

<p>Then intervened a brief campaign in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>mountains of the Isla Margarita; Torre went
there to take command. This is the famed
old island of pearls; they lie there in the
reefs amid the bones of men and ships.
Torre found no pearls, but he defeated the
royal troops in the first engagement resembling
an open battle he had ventured
fight. This matter settled, he lay awake
at night, and thought about his new ward.
Further tidings reached him from Carácas,
of his nephew. It was said young Ramon
boasted he would marry her. Then the
King, as is the royal way after defeat in battle,
made further concessions to the “Liberals,”
as the revolutionists were called; and
in the coaxing amity of the time, Torre was
permitted, nay, invited, to return to the capital.
He did so, and was immediately tendered
a banquet by the royal Governor, and
a ball at which his ward was present. The
royal Governor and his lady sat beneath a pavilion,
webbed of the scarlet and gold of
Spain. The Countess Dolores came and curtsied
deeply to them; then she rose the taller
for it, and as she turned haughtily away they
saw that she was almost robed in pearls;
three strands about her neck and six about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>her waist; and the ribbon in her mantilla was
pale green, white, and red. El Gobernador
only smiled at this, the liberal tricolor, and
made a pretty speech about it; but the vice-regal
lady made some ill-natured reference to
the pearls, as spoils from Margarita. Don
Ramon was standing by and heard it. The
General saw it not.</p>

<p>After the formal dance the General went
up to compliment his ward. This was the
first time he had seen her since his return;
for even he could not call save in the presence
of the family; and she had no other
family than himself. He could not call on
her until&mdash;unless&mdash;he married her. He said,
“I am glad my lady Countess is kinder to
our colors than my nephew.” He watched
her as he said this; she started, and at the
end of the sentence blushed. He saw her
blush. Then he bowed, as if to retire.</p>

<p>“The pearls,” she said, hastily, “are all I
have; see!” And the Marquis, bowing, saw
that the neck-strands were not a necklace,
but after passing thrice around her neck, descended
to be lost in the laces of her dress.</p>

<p>The Marquis ended his bow, and went back
to camp. Next week there came an Indian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>soldier to Dolores with a box of island pearls;
they were large as grapeshot, and went thrice
about her waist. But the General no longer
contradicted her engagement to his nephew.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> General had never known women;
he had only known what men (and
women, too) say of women. At Paris, and
Madrid, he had seen his friends see dancers,
figurantes; he did not confound other women
with these, but he had known none other.
Of girls, in particular, he was ignorant. A
man of Latin race never sees a girl; in
America, North America, it is different, and
one sometimes wonders if we justify it.</p>

<p>Some weeks after the General got back to
his camp (which was high up amid the huge
mountain, the first mainland that Columbus
saw, which fends the Gulf of Paria from the
sea), he was astounded by the appearance
of no less a person than his nephew Ramon.
He had broken with the royal cause, he said,
and come to seek service beneath his uncle.
He did not say what statement he had left
behind him in Carácas&mdash;no explanation was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>necessary in the then Venezuela for joining
any war&mdash;but how he had justified his delaying
his coming nuptials with Dolores. For he
loved her, this young fellow; yet he said&mdash;allowed
it to be said&mdash;that in the process <i>de se
ranger</i>, in the process of arrangement, for his
bride, that she might find her place unoccupied,
certain other arrangements had been
necessary which took time.</p>

<p>He did not tell this story to his uncle, who
took him and sought to make a soldier of
him. Not this story; but he told him that he
loved Dolores; and his uncle&mdash;was he not
twenty years younger?&mdash;believed him. Twenty
years, or fifteen; ’tis little difference when
you pass the decade.</p>

<p>But the General found him hard material
to work up. He was ready enough at a private
brawl; ready enough, if the humor struck
him, to go at the enemy; but not to lead his
men there. And his men were readier to
gamble with him than to follow him; though
brave enough, in a way.</p>

<p>Yet the General Marquis blinded his faults&mdash;aye,
and paid his debts&mdash;for when he lost
at “pharaon” a certain pearl he wore, the
uncle bought it back for him, with a caution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
to risk his money, not his honor; at
which the young captain grit his teeth, and
would have challenged any but a creditor.
And when a certain girl, a Spanish woman,
followed him to camp, del Torre knew of it,
and helped Ramon to bid her go; and if the
General thought the worse of him, he did not
think Dolores loved him less; for was not
Sebastian himself brought up on that cruel
half-truth that some women still do their sex
the harm to make a whole one? that women
love a rake reformed. Then came a battle, and
both were wounded, and more concessions
from his Catholic Majesty; and in their wake
the wounded gentlemen went back to Carácas.</p>

<p>The General’s hair was grayer, and in that
stay again he saw Dolores only once, and
that was in church. At mass, high mass, <i>Te
Deum</i>, for the Catholic Majesty’s concessions,
Don Ramon stood behind her chair; and del
Torre saw them from a pillar opposite, and
again the girl countess blushed. And after
mass the new Archbishop met him in the
street and talked&mdash;of him, and of his ward,
and of Don Ramon.</p>

<p>“He is a graceless reprobate,” said this
peon-priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>The Marquis sighed. “A soldier&mdash;for a
brave man there is always hope.”</p>

<p>The Archbishop eyed him.</p>

<p>“She loves him?”</p>

<p>“She loves him.”</p>

<p>“He is poor!”</p>

<p>“She is rich.”</p>

<p>“You should marry her,” said the Archbishop,
and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>A week after he met them all again; and
this was that evening in the garden.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow</span>, this arch-priest had been a peon,
and a soldier in del Torre’s army; and
then he had left it, and had seen the viceroy
and been traitor to the rebels, and so became
a priest; and then, heaven and the vice-queen
knew how, bishop; and but that his archiepiscopal
credentials were now fresh from
Rome, del Torre, still a Catholic, had called
him traitor! Del Torre could not like the
man, though he stood between him and God;
and he knew that disliking must be mutual;
and he marvelled, simple soldier! that the
intoxicating message came from him. But
he put this cup of heaven from his lips.</p>

<p>For del Torre, from his fierce August of
war, had learned to love this April maiden
with all his heart, and with all his life and
his strong soul. Were not his hairs gray,
and his face so worn and weather-beaten?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>And his heart&mdash;he had none fit for this lady
of the light. Enough that it was his pearls
that clasped her slender waist.</p>

<p>The Archbishop, too, had seen his gray
hairs; yet he thought that it was best? He
had said so. Perhaps he wanted her possessions
for the Church. His nephew Don
Ramon cursed the Archbishop for sitting
there that night, and saying to her&mdash;what?
Novitiate and convent, perhaps, or his own
sins. For the lady Dolores was devout as
only girls can be who have warm hearts and
noble souls, and are brought up in cloisters.</p>

<p>Del Torre stood on the other side of the
Calvary hill, where the sunset lay, and looked
at it, dimly&mdash;for his heart was breaking;
the Archbishop kept close his converse with
Dolores; perhaps he saw her fiery younger
lover lurking in the branches. She rose&mdash;she
and Jacinta&mdash;and the priest walked
home with them. He talked to her of nephew
Ramon and his crimes&mdash;not his sins
with women, for the priest, too, was a crafty
man, and did her sex no honor&mdash;but of his
gambling, his brawling, his unsaintliness.
He said Ramon was a coward; and when
Dolores’ pale cheek reddened, he marked it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>again; and when she broke at this, he told
her a trumped-up story of his last battle
under his grave uncle. For Dolores, noble
maiden, had not yet confessed her life’s love
to herself&mdash;how then to her confessor?</p>

<p>The Archbishop walked slowly home with
her, Jacinta just behind, and left her under
that old stone scutcheon on the door. Del
Torre and Don Ramon lingered behind; and
when they had passed her window, she was
sitting there, looking weary. The old General
passed by, sweeping off his hat, his eyes
on the ground. He had been talking to the
youth of all the duties of his life and love;
but Ramon was inattentive, watching for her.
As they passed her window Ramon lingered,
daring a word to Dolores through the iron
bars. He asked her for a rose she wore. She
looked at him a moment, then gave it to him,
with a message. The Marquis saw her give
the rose; he did not hear the message. Don
Ramon did; and his face turned the color of
a winter leaf. As he walked on, he crushed
the rose, then threw it in the gutter. For the
girl, womanlike, had told the rival first.</p>

<p>That night Ramon intoxicated himself in
some tavern brawl. He had a companion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>with him, not of his own sex; and when
another officer reproached him with it, for
his cousin, he swore that he would marry
her, and that she had been&mdash;&mdash; Then they
fought a duel, and both were wounded.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> General heard of it the next morning,
and it was even the Archbishop brought
him the news. The priest besought del Torre
to marry his ward, but he was obdurate; the
crafty priest wrestled with the soldier’s will
all through that day, and neither conquered.
But the General’s face looked worn; he argued,
only sadly, of the hot blood of youth,
of the hope in her love for the nephew, and
of his bravery. Then late in the day came
the young officer, wounded, the bandage on
his breast half stanching the heart’s blood he
had shed for her, and besought the general
not to give her to Don Ramon. Del Torre
stood as if at bay. “You love her too?” he
cried.</p>

<p>“Ay, and would save her,” said the young
man, faintly.</p>

<p>“You must protect her from this libertine,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>then said the priest. For he wished her to
marry the one he thought she loved not.</p>

<p>“She loves him!” sighed the General.</p>

<p>“You must save her&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will live with her, and guard her as my
own&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You may not,” said the priest.</p>

<p>“I am her guardian&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You may not&mdash;you must marry her.”</p>

<p>“I am old and she is young&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The holy Church demands it!”</p>

<p>“I love her not&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;” the lie stuck in
his lips.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon del Torre went to
see Dolores. She was at vesper service, and
he waited until she came back, pale. He began
to speak. “I have heard all,” she interrupted;
“Jacinta told me.” And again he
saw her blush.</p>

<p>Del Torre groaned; he turned aside.
Then he strode back to her, his sabre clanking
as he walked. “God forgive me if I err.
Dolores, you may not marry this man&mdash;you&mdash;you
must&mdash;Señorita Condesa, will you
marry me?”</p>

<p>Dolores looked up; she had been red, she
was now pale. So blushes lie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“Santissima Maria,” she said, below her
breath.</p>

<p>“The Church&mdash;the Archbishop&mdash;demand
it,” del Torre hurried on, not looking at her,
for he heard her exclamation. “I love you&mdash;well
enough&mdash;to wed you.” The soldier’s
voice broke, too feeble now to cry a charge.
He never saw her look at him. God pardon
him for looking down.</p>

<p>“You love me&mdash;well enough to wed me&mdash;&mdash;”
She had turned red again, and her
voice was low. He looked, and saw it.</p>

<p>“I will keep you, and watch over you,
Dolores, with my life. The Church demands
it&mdash;I am but a soldier&mdash;will you
marry me?”</p>

<p>Her dark head was bowed, and the purple
of her eyes he saw not.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said; but, oh, so gravely, so
coldly!</p>

<p>He bowed ceremoniously, and touched her
hand to his lips; then he turned and left
the stone-walled tropic garden. And as his
sabre clanked in the passage-way, she threw
herself on the hammock in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>And that is how they were affianced.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> love of a man for a girl is perhaps different
from any other passion our souls on
earth are tempered with. Daphnis and Chloe
are pretty, natural, charming to paint and
write <i>vers de société</i> about; but so simple as
to be shallow, so natural as to be replaceable.
To Daphnis, we know that any other Chloe
will be Chloe too. And they are in reality
selfish; they seek the consummation of their
wishes: he his, she hers. It may be the
same human energy; but in the fierce, almost
blasphemous, self-abnegation of the man’s
love, it seems as different a manifestation as
the earth-rending power of freezing water
from the swelling of a bud at spring. The
man can renounce his love; but he desires
her well-being with a will to which murder is
an incident and the will divine but an obstacle
to be overcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>The Archbishop had told del Torre that his
nephew had been married already&mdash;secretly,
but married&mdash;married to the woman who
came to seek him out at the camp. Against
this wall del Torre’s will had been beating
in vain before his own betrothal to Dolores
was announced. If she <i>could</i> not marry Ramon,
it might, indeed, be best she married
him. But it was with a fierce suspicion he
received his friends’ congratulations at his
club and camp. Among his officers no other
look or accent mingled with an unaffected
joy. But in the city, he fancied&mdash;he was
ever ready to fancy&mdash;among the young men,
a shade of irony in their congratulations on
his happiness. Was he not so old!</p>

<p>Don Ramon heard of it from Jacinta. Jacinta
was on the side of the younger man.
She looked upon del Torre’s gray hairs with
fierce eyes. Ramon’s liquid voice and peachy
lip had fascinated this supple creature of the
forest. Don Ramon heard; and his own answer
was characteristic.</p>

<p>“The old fool!”</p>

<p>Jacinta nodded impatiently. She asked
him for a message back. He took pen and
paper and wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Señorita Condesa</span>: Thou lovest me.
On the morning thou shalt wed Don Sebastian
I kill him.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Ramon del Torre.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>He read it over; then he stopped and
thought. His first impulse was to boast; his
second, to intrigue. He was not all tiger;
something of the serpent lay within the handsome
youth.</p>

<p>“I will send it this evening,” he said to
Jacinta. And in the evening this is what he
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Señorita Condesa</span>: The Archbishop is
my enemy and makes my uncle marry you.
Have you confessed to him? Surely, you
have loved me? On the day he marries you
he shall kill your</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Ramon.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>This letter he sent. So he played upon the
poor girl’s conscience, that as a child she had
given him a smile; and bragged even to her
that he had had her heart. This was Thursday,
March 19, 1812. The marriage was set
for the 26th. Ramon went to the club, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>café which served as club to the aristocracy
of Carácas, and announced publicly that his
uncle was forcing his ward to marry him
against his will. The General, when this
story was brought to him, winced, but only
replied: “My nephew knows I cannot fight
him; I must leave my honor to the kind
opinion of my friends.” This speech was
repeated&mdash;“to the kindness of my friends;”
and that night a dozen young gentlemen
called upon the marquis and asked to be permitted
to provoke Don Ramon. The General
refused it to all, with one wave of his
hand. “I marry my ward for family reasons;
my nephew must be permitted to
make what criticism he chooses.”</p>

<p>Don Ramon then announced his uncle a
coward, and promised to prevent the marriage
by force. Del Torre took no notice.
Jacinta had taken the letter to Dolores, but
Ramon got no reply. After his last threat,
however, he received a call from a Jesuit
priest, who was sent by the Archbishop and
hinted of the Inquisition. Then the young
man was silent for two days, and in devouring
his rage he produced this letter to Dolores:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dolores</span>: Hast thou confessed? And
why no answer to me?</p>

<p class="right4">“For death (<i>para la muerte</i>),</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Ramon.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>To this Jacinta brought back a line:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I shall confess upon my wedding-day.
My answer to my husband, with the message
that your Honour” (V., only, in Spanish)
“did not give.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Dolores, Condesa de Luna.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>For Ramon had never given the message
that went with the rose.</p>

<p>All this was in Holy Week. Palm Sunday
passed; the Wednesday came; Holy Thursday
was the day fixed for the wedding&mdash;by
the Archbishop’s special will.</p>

<p>Now, it must be remembered that in all
this time del Torre had spoken with Dolores
face to face three times, and three times
only. Each time he had seen her he had
mentioned his nephew’s name, and each time
she had changed color. He would have married
her to Don Ramon could he have done
so; even now he had dared but for Ramon’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>own conduct. But all this time del Torre
was in an agony of doubt, through which even
Ramon’s insults could not penetrate. He
would have sent Dolores to a convent, but
the archbishop forbade it; the priest feared
not Don Ramon against Don Sebastian;
perhaps, however, he feared him at the convent
doors. But all this time del Torre had
seen Dolores twice a day, at mass, where he
went and gazed upon her, dim through incense.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> Wednesday morning the Marquis del
Torre had a last interview with his
bride. She was to go to her last maidenly
confession on that day; and he called early in
the morning, in his uniform as General of the
Liberal army. When he came upon her she
was all in white and girt about with pearls.
Pearls were in her dark hair, pearls in the
folds of her white dress, pearls in her neck,
no other color about her save the magic amethystine
in her eyes. Her face was pale.</p>

<p>Del Torre bowed over her hand, then
stood beside her. After the greeting, he
said:</p>

<p>“Señorita Dolores, I am still your guardian&mdash;I
would only marry you to make you
happy. Do you think I can?” His lips
were paler than hers, and his voice sounded
cold. She only answered:</p>

<p>“Quite sure, señor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“And the rose I saw you give my nephew&mdash;is
it dead?”</p>

<p>Again the rush of color to her face; but,
after a start, she answered, “It is dead.”
She stammered slightly, trying to say more;
to relieve her embarrassment he rose and left
her. “Hasta mañaña!”</p>

<p>“Mañaña por la mañaña,” she answered,
forcing brightness in her voice. The marquis
went out into the sunlight; he felt his
heart as cold as hers.</p>

<p>But again Dolores burst into tears; then,
quickly drying them, she wrote a letter and
sealed it. Then she called Jacinta.</p>

<p>The Indian nurse came quickly, and as
she stood looking at Dolores a dog’s love
was in her eyes. “This letter&mdash;the marquis
must have it in the morning,” said the
countess.</p>

<p>“He shall have it&mdash;in the morning,” answered
Jacinta. Then Dolores went to her
confessor. And Jacinta could not read the
letter; so she took it to Don Ramon first,
and asked him what it was. And it was
Don Ramon read it, Jacinta looking on.</p>

<p>Then Ramon girt his sword about him, and
went to mass.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> soldiers in Carácas march to mass
and the service is performed at beat of
drum. At the muffled tap of a march the
regiment files in to fill the nave, and kneels,
ringing their bayonets upon the stones; the
people fill the sides, and stand behind the columns
on the aisles. The General was there,
as usual, but he could not see Dolores; she was
kneeling at a shrine upon one side, a shrine
of Mary, Mother of Pity. All the pictures
and gold images were heavily draped in crape,
for it was Holy Week. The brazen trumpets
of the military band sounded through the
Kyrie Eleison; the church was dark, for every
woman was in black until Good Friday, and
the crape hangings shrouded close the walls.
Del Torre stood erect in his green uniform,
but, save for his figure, the nave was a mass
of red and gold and glittering steel. He
looked for her; he looked back to the doors
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>which were thrown back inward; from the
dark, shrouded church he looked through into
the empty square, blazing with the zenith
sun of the equinox. Again a muffled drumbeat,
and the regiment knelt, with a rattle of
their bayonets, upon the stones; it was the
elevation of the host, and he, too, knelt and
crossed himself.</p>

<p>When mass was over, the soldiers filed
out first; as del Torre followed, he met the
wounded captain again, with bloodless cheeks.
“You are too pale to be out, sir,” said the
General, almost lovingly, his hand resting
lightly on the other’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don Ramon is outside,” he answered.</p>

<p>“I have no fear&mdash;the youth is mad,” said
del Torre.</p>

<p>It is the custom in Spanish America, now
forgotten in old Spain, to lead the holy images
of the church about the streets, with a slow
processional, before Good Friday. As del
Torre spoke, they found themselves behind
one of these. In this Church of Santa Teresia
is a famed old image of Christ bearing
the Cross, brought two centuries before from
Spain. It is especially venerated by the
merchants of Carácas; large sums are subscribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
by them each Easter time to dress it
up, thousands of dollars and doubloons. Behind
this image now they found themselves.
Eight chanting priests, in mourning black
and lilac, bore it on either side, but the
image was gay with beaten gold, borne
in a canopy of costly lace, a hundred tall
wax candles giving light. The priests move
very slowly, scarce a step a minute, making
stations at each shrine, so that to bear these
images from one church to another may take
half a day. Del Torre and the wounded
officer could not, of course, pass it; so that
it was half an hour when they reached the
open air, and the square nearly emptied of
the worshippers; del Torre heard the distant
band of the army down the mountain
slope.</p>

<p>As they came out into the heat, he felt a
slight shudder, like a quiver of the earth, and
thought it was the shock of seeing his nephew.
Don Ramon del Torre spoke loudly, disregarding
the presence of the bystanders, pressing
rudely by the sacred shrine, and crying
that the old man would not fight.</p>

<p>“There stands the old man that will wed
my cousin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“Mention not her name,” said General del
Torre&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“I would kill him first, but that his old
blood dare not spill itself for her.”</p>

<p>“Mention not her name,” said del Torre&mdash;&mdash;.
Then Ramon’s voice hissed louder.</p>

<p>“My cousin Dolores de Luna that has been
my mistress&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>That night a Jesuit priest, leaving the
King’s House, where he had confessed Dolores,
ran hastily to the Archbishop’s. While
he was there, another frightened messenger
brought the news that Don Sebastian and his
nephew had been fighting on Calvareo. But
Jacinta, crying, brought the news to the
Countess earlier, how Don Sebastian and
Don Ramon at last had met, and how the
nephew lay full of wounds upon the Calvary,
literally cut in pieces, killed at his own uncle’s
hands.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">D</span>olores</span> spent the night before the wedding
kneeling in the little chapel of her
dwelling. So we read that Eastern Catholics
“lay all that night in the form of a cross.”
She was praying for her husband that had
been to be&mdash;perhaps praying that he might
be still, praying for light to see if there were
sin in it. Perhaps she had remorses of her
own. She had known the dead man he had
killed as a boy, bold, reckless, wild; I suppose
she had looked at him once or twice. A
Southern maiden’s glances return to torture
her when they have led to blood; prudent
maids of other climes are chary of them for
tradition of some such reason.</p>

<p>Dolores never wept, but knelt there, dry-eyed,
praying. In intervals she thought,
“Would he be well enough to come?” as she
knew that he was gravely wounded; but
somehow she felt sure he would; and that if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>this marriage-bond were sin, he would venture
it for her sake. A woman’s conscience
rules her heart, even in Spain; but a man,
even Roman Catholic, will risk his own perdition
to save her sorrow, or that no sin be
hers. She must save him, she must be the
judge. And sunrise found her pale but decided.
Then she called Jacinta to her side,
and asked her if she had carried to her husband
(so she called him) her note.</p>

<p>Jacinta looked at her fiercely; but at the
word “Husband,” started. Then she said
she had torn it up.</p>

<p>At the Countess’s look she quailed, and
lied again. She had it still, she said.
Dolores bade her give it to him as he came
from early mass.</p>

<p>Then Jacinta cried and told the truth.
She admitted that she had given it to Don
Ramon.</p>

<p>Dolores heard this with the blood about
her heart, but sat there silent, while the Indian
woman grovelled at her feet. It was her
note, then, that caused the duel.</p>

<p>Then mine, too, is the sin, she thought, not
his alone; and this thought gave her joy.
But where was he? was he strong enough to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>come? She took her writing-case and wrote
an exact copy of her other note; and this was
what she had said, and Ramon had read, and
then had fought his uncle:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Señor</span>: The rose you asked of yesterday
I gave Don Ramon; but the message that
went with it was given him for you.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Maria Joespha Dolores, Condesa De Luna.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>As she finished writing, the General was
announced. His face was bloodless, but his
wounds had been carefully dressed, so that
the bandages could not be seen. He knelt
over her hand, though the kneeling set them
bleeding once again. But Dolores, timid
only in her love, still saw but remorse and
duty in his eyes. With him he brought his
own priest, a priest from the Liberal army.
“Pobra,” he said, “we must be married early&mdash;early
and privately.”</p>

<p>She sought his eyes timidly and tried to
say it; to say what words her note said in
her hand. But she could not. She could
only say, “I know&mdash;I have heard,” and she
clenched the letter closer in her hand. She
could not give it to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>Del Torre’s face could not turn whiter.
But he said: “Forgive me&mdash;only your forgiveness
I can ask. At noon, then?”</p>

<p>“At noon.” She saw him leave the house;
then, then she turned and cried to Jacinta:
“Run, run, and give him this letter&mdash;at the
Cathedral.”</p>

<p>And again, upon her wedding-morning,
Dolores went to pray. She was interrupted
by a visit from the Archbishop. Some presentiment
made her rise in apprehension;
and as she stood erect, she saw, through the
priest, the man. And she saw that he, too,
had her secret; first the lover, then the priest,
had found it out.</p>

<p>“This marriage must not be,” said he.</p>

<p>“Holy Father, I have confessed yesterday.”</p>

<p>“This marriage must not be. You loved
Don Ramon.”</p>

<p>Dolores’s lips curled. “I confessed, yesterday.
I see you have been told.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday ’twas a duty&mdash;to-day it is a
sin. Thou lovest Ramon.”</p>

<p>Then Dolores rose to her full height and
her blue eyes flamed like ice. “Sebastian,
the Liberador, him I love, in this life and the
next; God knows it, and Ramon knows it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>and now may you, and soon, please God,
shall he!”</p>

<p>All forewarned that he was, the priest
started at her vehemence. Fool that he had
been!</p>

<p>“He has murdered his nephew&mdash;and thou
art the cause.”</p>

<p>The Countess was silent. All Catholic
that she was, she had resolved to appeal from
his judgment to God’s.</p>

<p>“Thou wilt not obey?” said the priest.</p>

<p>Her lips half formed the word no.</p>

<p>“Then on thee and on him, on thy house
I pronounce the curse of God. Thy family
shall have cause to remember this day, this
Holy Thursday, until it and both thy names
shall have vanished from the earth.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Archbishop left the house
when del Torre came. She saw that he had
not been to church. But she was married to
him without another word. “If he has not
my note,” she thought, “he shall have it
soon.”</p>

<p>But before that night Jacinta, with the
note in her hand, was buried with ten thousand
others behind the closed cathedral
doors.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> this Thursday, March 26, 1812, while
the services of the Hours of Agony were
being celebrated in the great cathedral, in the
presence of ten thousand people, the mountains
trembled and the earth opened. The
multitude pressed for the doors, but they
opened inward, and the thronging masses
pressed them fast. At the second shock the
walls opened and the roof fell in. The Archbishop
and many priests were buried at the
altar. Thirty thousand people are said to
have perished. Many were swallowed in the
chasm that opened on the mountain-side,
like rents in a bulging sail bursted in a gale.
No stone houses in Carácas more than one-story
high were standing on that night&mdash;except
the old Spanish castle where, in the
tower-room, Dolores sat watching for her
husband.</p>

<p>Through all that night del Torre worked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>amid the ruins. At dawn he was brought
home insensible, fainting from his labors,
bleeding at his opened wounds. Dolores
met him at the door, and led the bearers to
the room that should have been their bridal-room.
There he was laid, and lay delirious
many weeks with fever. Dolores never left
his side.</p>

<p>The Archbishop was known to have been
killed. Jacinta, the bride knew, must have
perished too. The priest that had married
them stayed with her; but Dolores, though
brave enough to sin, was not false to her
faith. The over-wrought heart of the poor
girl and great noblewoman connected all
that had happened with what she deemed
her sins&mdash;firstly, that she had caused her
cousin’s death, her husband’s crime, but
chiefly that she had braved the Church, and
the curse its head, now dead, had launched
upon her and upon Carácas. That their
house alone was standing seemed only to
mark them guilty.</p>

<p>Dolores was a noble heart, and did not
falter in her course. She had followed love,
she had married him she loved; his wife she
was, his wife she would remain. But she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>sought no soothing palliation from the
friendly priest. She went to no confession;
in all her life she never would confess herself,
seek absolution again. Excommunicated she
would live, that the curse might rest on her
and not on him.</p>

<p>But ah, how ardently she watched for Sebastian’s
consciousness to come! for his
eyes to rest on hers again! She felt sure the
coldness in them now was gone. Delirious,
he raved of her and of his love; he that
never called her but by titles in his life, now
cried Dolores, Dolores, and she held his hand
and waited.</p>

<p>She bade the doctors tell her when his recovery
was likely to come. And then, when
one evening his hands moved, and he closed
his eyes and slept, she sat there trembling,
not daring to be beside him, but her face
turned away. That yearning cry&mdash;Dolores,
Dolores, had been stilled for hours; but the
night passed and still he was asleep. Then,
when it was broad sunlight, she heard a
sudden movement by the nurse, and the
priest began to pray in Latin, and her heart
stood still. He sat up; she retreated in the
shadow, toward the door. His voice spoke;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>but oh! how low, how weak&mdash;not as it had
been in his dreaming; alas! this was now
his right mind. He saw not her; his eyes
looked sanely out the window, through the
crowded city. “It was a sin to marry her,”
he said.</p>

<p>She was carried fainting to her room within
the tower, and there again she waited.
“Has he asked for me?” she ventured to
ask, at night.</p>

<p>He had asked for my lady, and they told
him she was ill. And the next day again;
and they had told him she was in her suite
about the tower. She dared not seek him
now. And flowers came to her from him,
but no further speech. Thrice he sent his
homage to her. He could not walk yet, but
he sent his homage to her. She asked to
know when he could walk; and they told
her they would let her know. So, one afternoon,
they told her he might walk the next
day; and all that night she passed in prayer.</p>

<p>The next day she waited for his step upon
the stone floor. It came not; to her tears
and prayers, it came not. Jacinta’s dead
hand still held close the note. She prayed&mdash;was
it wrong to pray when so unshrived?&mdash;to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Maria Vergen de las Mercedes, but still it
came not. Her haughty Spanish breeding
forbade her showing sorrow to her servants,
and they were cold and deferential to her.
Jacinta? She was dead&mdash;Dolores knew, but
thought that she had given him her letter.
She had sinned, yes, but he was her husband.</p>

<p>The next day she asked the servant. The
Señor General was gone. Gone? without
seeing her even? He had had to go to the
wars; he had not ventured to disturb my
lady; he left a letter. A letter? she tore it
open, read it. It sent his respectful worship
to “the Marquesa;” it apologized for his illness;
it prayed forgiveness from her for having
married her; it was done to save her
name. It said no word of love; and Sebastian
Ruy del Torre was a gentleman: his
love appeared not in his letter. If she loved
him not, he would not wound her by showing
his. It said no word of guilt. He would
neither wound her by requiring love nor by
suggesting blame; but to Dolores’s morbid
fancy it had a sense of blame. It closed by
speaking of his duty at the wars; of his
country’s freedom; perhaps, a hint of hers.
Dolores clasped the white paper to her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>breast, and, to immortal eyes its color was
of blood. She read it once again; and del
Torre, had he been there, could have seen
her heart die in her eyes.</p>

<p class="ph2 nobreak" id="XIII">XIII.</p></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e</span> must remember that Maria Josepha
Dolores, Condesa del Torre y Luna,
was a lonely young girl, educated but from
books, devoutedly believing in a faith we like
to think superstitious. Remember, please,
also, that she loved, and braved her Church
for love, and had not, so she thought, won his.
She deemed her soul was damned; she knew
her heart was broken. Not that there were
no days when she did dare hope; no days
in which she tried to frame a theory by
which it still might seem he cared for her;
but she believed he was borne down by their
great guilt. And she resolved his soul, at
least, would not be lost for hers. “My lady
Marquesa would have her apartments in all
the house,” the letter said. “My lady had
but to command. A small room in the tower
was enough for him&mdash;he could but rarely be
home from the wars. He trusted, if his presence<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
was painful, she would not see him,”
etc., etc. And, after many months, when the
General came back&mdash;his wife met him not.
The rooms of state were carefully prepared
for him, and all his suite; flowers, banquets
were ready; all his retinue and hers, in their
joint blazonry, were in attendance. Only,
strangely enough, just that little tower-room
was the one my lady Marchioness preferred.
Would he kindly yield it to her?</p>

<p>Of course, and the General sent her a rope
of pearls. They almost broke her resolution;
but she met him not. The General only
sighed; this was all as he had known. The
evil nephew, done to death by his own hand,
still had her heart. He sighed and his hair
grew whiter. One rending memory came over
him, of the last time he had seen her eyes.</p>

<p>He could not know, as he rode homeward
up the street, after his first state visits,
straining his eyes up to that tower-window
frowning so blankly, how late her own had
left it&mdash;those eyes of purple-gray that every
beggar in Carácas soon knew well, save only
he. Before the next return his glory blazed
abroad, and Bolivar came back with him.
Bolivar, the Liberator. All thoughtful preparation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
all courtly care, all a Spanish grandee’s
splendor was spread forth to receive
him in the Casa Rey; but the châtelaine was
never seen. It was not necessary to explain
her absence; such things get quickly known;
it was, of course, thought she had loved the
cousin. And the strange Old-world Gothic
pride made her bearing, the honor of the
house, del Torre’s silence, only too easily
intelligible to them. So the Marquis del
Torre never saw his bride on his returning
home.</p>

<p>But, had he known it, he never opened a
door that she had not vanished through
it. He never touched a flower she had not
placed for him. He never looked in a mirror
her gray eyes had not just left. He
never touched a wine-glass to his lips that
her lips had not kissed it. The very missal
that he read from had been warmed within
her bosom.</p>

<p>O, ghosts, and mediums, and vulgar spirits
of air! and stupid tables, mirrors that are
flattered with tales of second sight! Why
did you not hold a look of hers one moment
longer? why did not the roses keep a second
longer her lips’ breath for him? Poor fables<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
of visions in the air, that could not draw
the image of her eyes to his as he rode up
the street scarce a hundred mortal bodies’
breadths away! But they never did; he
never saw her, she saw him only as he rode
away upon his horse; and so for many&mdash;nay,
not many (such poor slight power has
heaven)&mdash;not for many, years. And as his
horse bore him away, she came to the tower-window
and watched him go&mdash;and there she
sat weeks, months, until the pennons flashed
or the trumpet’s note announced to her, waiting,
that he was come again. For he always
came in such guise, announced with ceremony.
And he did not dream her eyes had
been at the tower-window ever since. For
their eyes never met.</p>

<p>But the people knew, and so they called
her “Our Lady of the Tower.” And Nuestra
Doña del Torre is she called there still. And
thus they lived there alone within that great
house, each for pity of the other in courage,
each for awe of love in silence; each so loving,
so brave, so silent, that the other never
knew.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“N</span>uestra Doña del Torre</span>”&mdash;by
that title, I fancy, she is known in
heaven. For in that city all the good that
was worked was hers; after the earthquake,
then through siege and civil war, her heart
directed her handmaidens, ladies loving her
did her soft work. Her own life was but a
gentle message. For she never but for the
convent left her tower-room. Thither, however,
poor old men, children, troubled girls,
would come to see her.</p>

<p>All this time Bolivar was battling with the
might of Spain, and del Torre (del Torre y
Luna now he always called himself, liking, at
least, to link his name with hers; but she
had dropped her own name and called herself
del Torre alone&mdash;Maria Dolores del
Torre) was Bolivar’s captain. Years the war
lasted. Once our General was captured in
the city; he came to Carácas at a time of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>war, when it was legal for the Governor to
capture him; he had heard some rumor that
his wife was ill. He would have been shot
but that he escaped from gaol, and this so
easily that the prison doors seemed to turn of
themselves. No youth, or woman, or child
in all Carácas but would have turned a traitor
for our lady.</p>

<p>Del Torre’s face looked old&mdash;Dolores knew
it not. She never saw him&mdash;except, perhaps,
a distant figure on a horse. When he was
out, she roamed the house; when he came
back she shut herself within her apartments.
He never returned, from the shortest absences,
a walk or a mass, without making
formal announcement. He wondered only at
the flowers; the perfections of his banquets,
the splendor of his household, were for his
guest and as it should be. At first del Torre
had hoped to see at least a handkerchief fly
from her window, a greeting or a wave of the
hand, on his return. But it was always
black and blank when he saw it. At first,
this cost him tears: a greeting seemed so little&mdash;only
courtesy! But afterward he only
sighed; no man should repine that events fulfil
his expectations rather than his hopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>Their money grew apace. With part of
hers Dolores built a church at Los Teques, a
property that had been her mother’s, not far
from the city. Half her time she spent
there; and it stands there still, and is called
after the Vergen de las Mercedes&mdash;Our Lady
of Pity&mdash;to whom alone Dolores dared to
pray. But the Church took her treasure and
it kept her secret. Sometimes, in God’s
providence, even pity is withheld.</p>

<p>One’s heart beats quick to think what
might have happened had she ventured to
confession&mdash;the priest who married them still
was with her, in the household, an honest
priest, who loved del Torre, too. But Rome,
which knows how to be gentle as a mother,
can also be as cruel as the grave. So Dolores
went on in building churches, and Don Sebastian
offered his brave heart wherever he
saw a bullet fly for liberty. The best work
of the world is done by broken hearts.</p>

<p>One time that he came home, he found a
medallion by his plate. It was set with
pearls, in tricolor enamel. He opened it, and
it was a miniature of her. Then once a rush
of human blood bore all his barriers of honor,
duty, resolves of conduct, far away. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>hastened through the house to the tower,
where she lived. He hastened&mdash;crying Dolores,
Dolores, as he had cried in his delirium.
Her maid opened&mdash;not Jacinta, but Jacinta’s
daughter, now a woman. My Lady
Marquesa had gone to the convent at Los
Teques for some weeks’ prayer.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter</span> this, del Torre’s body grew
broken, with his heart.</p>

<p>It was the last campaign of liberation.
The final battle was fought not far from Los
Teques, where the convent was; and the
wall of the church of the Vergen de las Mercedes
was scarred with balls. The fight was
over, the country was free. And the General
at last was killed.</p>

<p>Bolivar himself went with del Torre’s body
to Carácas; our General’s <i>corps d’armée</i> were
his pall-bearers. The news, of course, had
been sent to the city; the Governor had
fled; the General’s tri-color now, the red-white-green
of Colombia, was floating over
the Capitol. All the town was gay with
banners, merry with song. It had forgotten
the earthquake, and was now rebuilt, though
lower down. The Casa Rey now stood at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>head of the principal street, which sloped
from it down the mountain side. And as the
regiment escorting his body debouched into
this avenue and turned upward (as its dead
leader had so often done before), and the
town came in view, there was a great hush
upon the people. For lo! Now, at last, the
window of the tower was wide open and the
house bore all no black, but was festooned
with laughing tri-color. And the window of
the tower was open, and there within stood
our Lady Dolores, in her white wedding
laces, waving her hand.</p>

<p>She met them at the great door. Bolivar,
and the officers who had been with our General,
started. For, as she stood there in her
slender satin gown, her eyes upon them, she
was like a young girl. And her girlish
waist was bound about with pearls.</p>

<p>The fact was, she was seven-and-twenty.
They placed his bier first in the great room;
but she would have it in hers, so in the tower-room
they placed it, with burning candles
standing sentry now where she had stood;
and by its side were lilies&mdash;the flower of the
Holy Ghost&mdash;and then they left her. Then
first, since her wedding-day, she looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>upon him, face to face, his eyes now dead to
see. Their eyes so met. And outside, from
the city now again joyous, came the carillon
of freedom bells.</p>

Luna; and of Maria Josepha Dolores del
Torre, Condesa de Luna, his wife; and of
the old stone castle that alone the earthquake
left standing in the pleasant city of
Carácas.</p>

<p>The Holy Catholic Church had alone their
secret; and she kept it; and now she has,
laid up on earth, their treasure too. No
longer such grim motives vex their country;
if she battles with herself, it is for money or
for acres of wide coffee land. Such cruel tales
cannot be found there now. But, perhaps,
withal, some touch of noble life is vanished,
with that flag of blood and gold. Good cannot
grow bravely without evil in this world.</p>

<p>You may see the Casa Rey still standing
in the sombre street, and the empty tower
window there. The Marquesa del Torre y
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>Luna died, quite old, more than a score of
years ago. Her blue eyes are no longer
there. Perhaps they are in heaven, and now

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
